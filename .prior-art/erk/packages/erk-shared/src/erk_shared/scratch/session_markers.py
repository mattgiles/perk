"""Session-scoped marker utilities for plan save state tracking.

These markers are stored in the session scratch directory and track
plan save state within a session. They are distinct from worktree-scoped
markers in markers.py.

Markers:
    exit-plan-mode-hook.plan-saved.marker: Signals plan was saved to GitHub.
        Content: plan number on first line. Triggers Step 2 "what next?" prompt.
    plan-saved-issue.marker: Stores the issue/PR number of the saved plan
        (persists for session deduplication, not consumed by hook).
