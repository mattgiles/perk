"""Registry of skills portable to Codex CLI.

Codex is a generic AI coding agent framework. Skills in codex_portable_skills()
work with any AI coding agent (not Claude-specific).

Skills in claude_only_skills() reference Claude-specific features like hooks,
session logs, or Claude Code commands and cannot be ported to Codex.
