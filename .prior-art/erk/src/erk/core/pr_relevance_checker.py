"""Commit-history relevance check for plans via LLM inference.

This module checks whether a plan's work has already been implemented
by comparing plan content against recent commits merged to the trunk
branch. This is a separate concern from duplicate detection (plan-vs-plan)
so it has its own class, system prompt, and result type.

Mirrors the PlanDuplicateChecker pattern: concrete class, PromptExecutor
injection, model="haiku", frozen result dataclass.

You are a commit-history relevance checker. Given a PLAN and a list of \
RECENT COMMITS from the trunk branch, determine whether the plan's work \
has already been implemented by those commits.

Compare the plan's intent and goals against what the commits accomplished. \
A plan is "already implemented" only if the commits fully address the \
plan's primary objective. Partial overlap is NOT sufficient.

Respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
{
  "already_implemented": true,
  "relevant_commits": [{"sha": "abc1234", "explanation": "why"}]
}

If no relevant commits, respond: {"already_implemented": false, "relevant_commits": []}

Rules:
- Only flag as already_implemented if commits fully cover the plan's goal
- Commits that touch similar files for different purposes are NOT relevant
- A commit that partially addresses the plan is NOT sufficient
- Be conservative: when in doubt, say NOT already implemented"""
