"""Rebase onto target branch and resolve conflicts with Claude.

This command handles merge conflicts during CI workflows by:
1. Fetching the target branch (trunk or parent branch for stacked PRs)
2. Checking if the current branch is behind
3. Starting a rebase
4. Using Claude to resolve any conflicts
5. Force pushing after successful rebase
6. Generating an intelligent summary of the rebase operation

Usage:
    erk exec rebase-with-conflict-resolution \
        --target-branch master \
        --branch-name feature-branch \
        --model claude-sonnet-4-5

Output:
    Natural language summary suitable for PR comments.

Exit Codes:
    0: Success (rebase completed and pushed, or already up-to-date)
    1: Error (conflict resolution failed after max attempts)

Examples:
    $ erk exec rebase-with-conflict-resolution --target-branch main --branch-name my-feature
    Rebased `my-feature` onto `main`, resolving 3 commits behind.
    Resolved merge conflicts in 2 files:
    - src/config.py: Merged new logging settings with updated timeout values
    - tests/test_api.py: Combined new test cases with fixture updates

    $ erk exec rebase-with-conflict-resolution \
        --target-branch feature-parent --branch-name my-feature
    Branch `my-feature` is already up-to-date with `feature-parent` (no rebase needed).

Fix all merge conflicts in this repository and continue the rebase.

Steps:

1. Run `git status` to identify all conflicted files.

2. For each conflicted file, check for the `<!-- AUTO-GENERATED FILE -->` header comment:
   - Auto-generated files (e.g., tripwires.md, index.md with the auto-generated header): \
accept either side with `git checkout --theirs <file>`, stage with `git add`. \
After the rebase completes, regenerate them (e.g., `erk docs sync` for tripwires/index files).
   - Real content files: proceed to step 3.

3. For each real content file:
   a. Read the file and understand both sides of the conflict:
      - `<<<<<<< HEAD` = local changes
      - `=======` separates local from incoming
      - `>>>>>>> <commit>` = incoming changes
   b. Determine what each side was trying to accomplish.
   c. Resolve intelligently:
      - If changes are complementary, merge both
      - If changes conflict semantically, prefer the more recent/complete version
      - If genuinely unclear, prefer the incoming (upstream) version
   d. Remove all conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
   e. Stage the resolution: `git add <file>`

4. After resolving all conflicts, stage resolved files and run `git rebase --continue`.

5. If more conflicts appear, repeat from step 1.

6. After rebase completes, regenerate any auto-generated files resolved in step 2 \
(e.g., run `erk docs sync`).
