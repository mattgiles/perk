"""Update objective after landing a PR.

Standalone exec script that calls Claude to update the linked objective
after a PR has been merged. Always exits 0 (fail-open) because the
landing has already succeeded.

This is a thin wrapper around the shared helper in objective_helpers.py.
It remains available for manual retries via:
    erk exec objective-update-after-land --objective 42 --pr 123 --branch feature

Exit Codes:
    0: Always (fail-open - landing already succeeded)
