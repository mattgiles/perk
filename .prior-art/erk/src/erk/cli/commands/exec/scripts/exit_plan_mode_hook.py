"""Exit Plan Mode Hook.

Prompts user before exiting plan mode when a plan exists. This hook intercepts
the ExitPlanMode tool via PreToolUse lifecycle to ask whether to save to GitHub
or implement immediately.

Exit codes:
    0: Success (allow exit - no plan, implement-now marker present, or no session)
    2: Block (plan exists, no implement-now marker - prompt user)

This command is invoked via:
    erk exec exit-plan-mode-hook

Marker File State Machine
=========================

This hook uses marker files in .erk/scratch/sessions/<session-id>/ for state management.
Marker files are self-describing: their names indicate their purpose and their contents
explain their effect.

Marker Files:
    exit-plan-mode-hook.implement-now.marker
        Created by: Agent (when user chooses "Implement without saving")
        Effect: Next ExitPlanMode call is ALLOWED (exit plan mode, proceed to implementation)
        Lifecycle: Deleted after being read by next hook invocation

    exit-plan-mode-hook.plan-saved.marker
        Created by: /erk:plan-save command (both new-branch and current-branch paths)
        Content: First line is the plan PR number
        Effect: Next ExitPlanMode call is BLOCKED with Step 2 "what next?" prompt
        Lifecycle: Deleted after being read by next hook invocation

    incremental-plan.marker
        Created by: /local:incremental-plan-mode command (via `erk exec marker create --session-id`)
        Effect: Next ExitPlanMode call is ALLOWED, skipping the save prompt entirely
        Lifecycle: Deleted after being read by next hook invocation
        Purpose: Streamlines "plan → implement → submit" loop for PR iteration

State Transitions:
    1. No marker files + plan exists → BLOCK with Step 1 prompt (save/implement/edit)
    2. implement-now marker exists → ALLOW (delete marker)
    3. incremental-plan marker exists → ALLOW (delete marker, skip save prompt)
    4. plan-saved marker exists → BLOCK with Step 2 plain-text next-steps (delete marker)
