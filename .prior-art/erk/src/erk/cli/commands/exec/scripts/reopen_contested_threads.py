"""Detect and reopen contested resolved PR review threads.

A "contested" thread is one that was resolved by erk:pr-address (identified by
the PR_ADDRESS_MARKER in a comment) but has received additional reviewer comments
after the last marker comment.

This exec command fetches all resolved threads, detects contested ones, and
unresolves them so they will be picked up by subsequent pr-address runs.

Usage:
    erk exec reopen-contested-threads
    erk exec reopen-contested-threads --pr 123

Output:
    JSON with result summary

Exit Codes:
    0: Always (even on error, to support non-blocking use)

Examples:
    $ erk exec reopen-contested-threads
    {
      "success": true,
      "pr_number": 123,
      "contested_threads": [...],
      "total_resolved_checked": 5,
      "total_contested": 1,
      "total_reopened": 1
    }
