# /erk:replan

Recomputes existing plan(s) against the current codebase state, creating a new plan and closing the original(s).

Supports consolidating multiple plans into a single unified plan.

## Usage

```bash
/erk:replan 2521                          # Single plan replan
/erk:replan https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/2521
/erk:replan 123 456 789                   # Consolidate multiple plans
```

---

## Agent Instructions

### Step 1: Parse Plan References

Split `$ARGUMENTS` on whitespace. For each argument:

- If numeric (e.g., `2521`), use directly as pr number
- If URL (e.g., `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/2521`), extract the number from the path

Store all pr numbers in a list. Set `CONSOLIDATION_MODE=true` if multiple plans provided.

If no argument provided, ask the user for the pr number.

### Step 2: Validate Plans and Extract Metadata (Delegated)

Delegate all validation and metadata extraction to a single `general-purpose` haiku Task agent. This keeps the 2N bash calls (N × `get-pr-info` + N × `get-pr-metadata`) out of the main conversation context.

Launch a Task agent with:

- `subagent_type`: `general-purpose`
- `model`: `haiku`

**Agent prompt** (adapt pr numbers from Step 1):

> For each of the following PR numbers: [list pr numbers]
>
> 1. Run `erk exec get-pr-info <number>` for each plan
> 2. Run `erk exec get-pr-metadata <number> objective_issue` for each plan
>
> Then return a structured summary in EXACTLY this format:
>
> ```
> VALIDATION: PASS or FAIL
> CONSOLIDATION_MODE: true or false (true if multiple plans)
> IS_LEARN_PLAN: true or false (true if ANY plan has erk-learn label)
>
> PLANS:
> # | Title | State | erk-pr | erk-learn | objective_issue
> <number> | <title> | <open/closed> | <yes/no> | <yes/no> | <number or none>
> ...
>
> OBJECTIVE_STATUS: AGREED:<number>, AGREED:none, or CONFLICT
>
> ERRORS:
> <only present if VALIDATION is FAIL, list each error>
>
> WARNINGS:
> <only present if any issues are closed, list each warning>
> ```
>
> Rules for OBJECTIVE_STATUS:
>
> - AGREED:<number> — all plans that have an objective_issue share the same value
> - AGREED:none — no plans have an objective_issue
> - CONFLICT — plans have different objective_issue values
>
> Rules for VALIDATION:
>
> - FAIL if any plan does not exist
> - FAIL if any plan is missing BOTH the erk-pr AND erk-learn labels (must have at least one)
> - PASS otherwise (closed plans are warnings, not failures)

**After the agent returns**, parse the structured summary:

1. **If VALIDATION is FAIL**: Display each error and abort:

   ```
   Error: PR #<number> is not a valid plan (missing both erk-pr and erk-learn labels).
   ```

   ```
   Error: PR #<number> not found.
   ```

2. **If WARNINGS present**: Display each warning but continue:

   ```
   Warning: PR #<number> is already closed. Proceeding with replan anyway.
   ```

3. **Store extracted data**:
   - `IS_LEARN_PLAN` from the summary
   - `CONSOLIDATION_MODE` from the summary
   - Each plan's title (from the ISSUES table)
   - Resolved `objective_issue`:
     - If OBJECTIVE_STATUS is `AGREED:<number>`, use that number
     - If OBJECTIVE_STATUS is `AGREED:none`, no objective
     - If OBJECTIVE_STATUS is `CONFLICT`, ask the user which objective to use

### Step 3: Plan Content Fetching (Delegated to Step 4)

Plan content is fetched by each Explore agent in Step 4, not in the main context.
This avoids dumping large plan bodies into the main conversation.

Skip to Step 4.

### Step 4: Deep Investigation

Use the Explore agent (Task tool with subagent_type=Explore) to perform deep investigation of the codebase.

**If CONSOLIDATION_MODE:**

Launch parallel Explore agents (one per plan, using `run_in_background: true`), each investigating:

- Plan items and their current status
- Overlap potential with other plans being consolidated
- File mentions and their current state

**For each plan (parallel or sequential):**

#### 4a: Fetch Plan Content (Agent's First Action)

Each Explore agent MUST fetch its plan's content as its first action. This keeps the raw plan content inside the agent's context instead of the main conversation.

**Fetch command:**

```bash
erk exec get-pr-info <number> --include-body
```

**Parse the response:** The JSON response includes a `body` field containing the full plan content. Extract `body` from the JSON output.

**If the command fails (exit code 1):**

Return an error to the main agent:

```
Error: PR #<number> not found.
```

The agent should fail early if it cannot fetch the plan content, rather than proceeding with incomplete information.

#### 4b: Check Plan Items Against Codebase

For each implementation item in the plan (now fetched in 4a):

- Search for relevant files, functions, or patterns
- Determine status: **implemented**, **partially implemented**, **not implemented**, or **obsolete**

Build a comparison table showing:

| Plan Item | Current Status | Notes |
| --------- | -------------- | ----- |
| ...       | ...            | ...   |

#### 4c: Deep Investigation (MANDATORY)

Go beyond the plan items to understand the actual implementation:

1. **Data Structures**: Find all relevant types, dataclasses, and their fields
2. **Helper Functions**: Identify utility functions and their purposes
3. **Lifecycle & State**: Understand how state flows through the system
4. **Naming Conventions**: Document actual names used (not guessed names)
5. **Entry Points**: Map all places that trigger the relevant functionality
6. **Configuration**: Find config options, defaults, and overrides

#### 4d: Document Corrections and Discoveries

Create two lists per plan:

1. **Corrections to Original Plan**: Wrong assumptions, incorrect names, outdated information
2. **Additional Details**: Implementation specifics, architectural insights, edge cases

### Step 4e: Consolidation Analysis (CONSOLIDATION_MODE only)

If consolidating multiple plans:

1. **Identify Overlap**: Find items that appear in multiple plans
2. **Merge Strategy**: Determine how to combine overlapping items
3. **Dependency Ordering**: Order items by dependency across all plans
4. **Attribution Tracking**: Track which items came from which plan

### Step 4f: Wait for All Background Investigations (CRITICAL)

**BEFORE proceeding to Step 5 or Step 6, you MUST wait for ALL background agents to complete.**

If you launched agents with `run_in_background: true`:

1. **Check agent status**: Use TaskOutput with `block: true` to wait for each background agent
2. **Collect all results**: Do not proceed until every agent has returned its findings
3. **Synthesize findings**: Combine results from all agents into a unified investigation summary

**Why this matters:**

- Background agents may discover critical corrections or implementation details
- Creating the plan before investigations complete leads to incomplete or inaccurate plans
- The consolidated plan quality depends on having ALL investigation data

**How to wait:**

For each background agent task_id, use TaskOutput tool with:

- `block: true` to wait for completion
- `timeout: 600000` (10 minutes)

Then read the agent's findings from the output.

Only after ALL agents have completed should you proceed to Step 5.

### Step 5: Post Investigation to Original Plan(s)

Before creating the new plan, post investigation findings to each original plan as a comment:

```bash
gh pr comment <original_number> --body "## Deep Investigation Notes (for implementing agent)

### Corrections to Original Plan
- [List corrections discovered]

### Additional Details Not in Original Plan
- [List new details discovered]

### Key Architectural Insights
- [List important discoveries]"
```

If consolidating, include note:

```
Note: This plan is being consolidated with #<other_numbers> into a unified plan.
```

### Step 6: Create New Plan (Always)

**Always create a new plan**, regardless of implementation status.

#### 6a: Gather Investigation Context

Before entering Plan Mode, collect all investigation findings from Steps 4-5:

1. **Investigation status per plan**: Completion percentages (e.g., "4/11 items implemented")
2. **Specific discoveries**: File paths, line numbers, commit hashes, PR numbers
3. **Corrections found**: What the original plan(s) got wrong
4. **Codebase evidence**: Actual function names, class signatures, config values

For consolidation mode, also gather:

- **Overlap analysis**: Which items appeared in multiple plans
- **Merge decisions**: Why items were combined or kept separate
- **Attribution map**: Which source plan contributed each item

#### 6b: Enter Plan Mode with Full Context

Use EnterPlanMode to create an updated plan.

**CRITICAL:** The plan content MUST include the investigation findings, not just summarize them. Each implementation step should have:

- **Specific file paths** (e.g., `docs/learned/architecture/gateway-inventory.md:45`)
- **What to change** (not "update X" but "add entry for CommandExecutor with ABC at line 105")
- **Evidence** (commit hashes, PR numbers, current line numbers)
- **Verification criteria** (how to confirm the step is complete)

**Anti-pattern (sparse):**

```
1. Update gateway documentation
2. Add missing tripwires
```

**Correct pattern (comprehensive):**

```
1. **Update gateway-inventory.md** (`docs/learned/architecture/gateway-inventory.md`)
   - Add missing entries: CommandExecutor (abc.py:105), PlanDataProvider (abc.py:142)
   - Fix import paths at lines 45, 67 (change `erk.gateways.` → `erk.gateway.`)
   - Verification: All gateways in `src/erk/gateway/` have entries
```

# Plan: [Unified Title]

> **Consolidates:** #123, #456, #789

## Source Plans

| #   | Title             | Items Merged |
| --- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| 123 | [Title from plan] | X items      |
| 456 | [Title from plan] | Y items      |
| 789 | [Title from plan] | Z items      |

## What Changed Since Original Plans

- [List major codebase changes affecting any of the plans]

## Investigation Findings

- **#123**: [corrections]
- **#456**: [corrections]
- **#789**: [corrections]

### Additional Details Discovered

- [Combined implementation specifics]

### Overlap Analysis

- [Items that appeared in multiple plans, now merged]

4. [Step] _(from #789)_

## Attribution

Items by source:

- **#123**: Steps 1, 2
- **#456**: Steps 2, 3
- **#789**: Step 4
```

### Step 7: Save and Close

After the user approves the plan in Plan Mode:

1. Exit Plan Mode
2. Run `/erk:plan-save` to create the new plan:
   - **If any source plan(s) had `erk-learn` label** (`IS_LEARN_PLAN=true`): Add `--plan-type=learn` to the command
   - **If the source plan(s) had an `objective_issue`**: Pass `--objective=<number>` to `/erk:plan-save`:
     ```
     /erk:plan-save --objective=<objective_number>
     ```
   - **If consolidating with conflicting objectives**: Use the objective chosen by the user in Step 2 via `--objective=<number>`
   - **Otherwise**: Run `/erk:plan-save` without flags
3. **If an objective was linked**, verify the link was saved correctly:
   ```bash
   erk exec get-pr-metadata <new_pr_number> objective_issue
   ```
   If the objective link is missing, fix it with:
   ```bash
   erk exec update-pr-header <new_pr_number> objective_issue=<number>
   ```
4. **If CONSOLIDATION_MODE** (multiple plans consolidated), add the `erk-consolidated` label:
   ```bash
   echo "[{\"pr_number\": <new_pr_number>, \"label\": \"erk-consolidated\"}]" | erk exec add-pr-labels-batch
   ```
   This prevents the consolidated plan from being re-consolidated by `/local:replan-learn-plans`.
5. Close original plan(s) with comment linking to the new one:

**Single plan:**

```bash
echo "[{\"pr_number\": <original_number>, \"comment\": \"Superseded by #<new_number> - see updated plan that accounts for codebase changes.\"}]" | erk exec close-prs
```

**Consolidated plans:**

```bash
echo '[{"pr_number": 123, "comment": "Consolidated into #<new_number> with #456, #789"}, {"pr_number": 456, "comment": "Consolidated into #<new_number> with #123, #789"}, {"pr_number": 789, "comment": "Consolidated into #<new_number> with #123, #456"}]' | erk exec close-prs
```

Display final summary:

**Single plan:**

```
✓ Created new PR #<new_number>
✓ Closed original PR #<original_number>

Next steps:
- Review the new plan: gh pr view <new_number>
- Dispatch for implementation: erk pr dispatch <new_number>
```

**Consolidated plans:**

```
✓ Created consolidated PR #<new_number>
✓ Closed original PRs: #123, #456, #789

Source plans consolidated:
- #123: [title]
- #456: [title]
- #789: [title]

Next steps:
- Review the consolidated plan: gh pr view <new_number>
- Dispatch for implementation: erk pr dispatch <new_number>
```

### Step 8: Validate New Plan

After saving and closing, verify the new plan is in a healthy state:

```bash
erk exec get-pr-info <new_pr_number>
```

Check the returned labels:

- Has `erk-pr` label (required for dispatch)
- If CONSOLIDATION_MODE: has `erk-consolidated` label
- If IS_LEARN_PLAN: has `erk-learn` label

If any expected label is missing, add it:

```bash
erk exec add-pr-label <new_pr_number> --label "<missing_label>"
```

Display validation result:

```
✓ PR #<number> validated: OPEN, labels: [list of labels]
```

If validation finds the plan is not OPEN, report the issue and stop.

## Important Notes

- **DO NOT implement the plan** - This command only creates an updated plan
- **DO NOT skip codebase analysis** - Always verify current state before replanning
- **Use Explore agent** for comprehensive codebase searches (Task tool with subagent_type=Explore)
- **Parallel investigation** for multiple plans (run_in_background: true)
- Original plan(s) closed only after the new plan is successfully created
- The new plan references all original plan(s) for traceability
