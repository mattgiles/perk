# One-Shot Plan

You are running autonomously in a CI workflow. Your job is to read a prompt, explore the codebase, create a detailed implementation plan, and save it as a planned PR.

**Important:** You are ONLY planning, not implementing. The plan must be self-contained — a separate Claude session will implement it with no access to your exploration context.

## Step 1: Read the Prompt

Read `.erk/impl-context/prompt.md` to understand what you need to do.

## Step 2: Read Objective Context (if present)

If the `$OBJECTIVE_ISSUE` environment variable is set (non-empty), this plan is for a specific node of an objective. Use `erk exec check-objective $OBJECTIVE_ISSUE` to fetch the full objective context (title, roadmap, progress). The `$NODE_ID` environment variable contains the specific roadmap node ID being planned. Incorporate the objective context into your planning — understand the broader goal and how this node fits into it.

## Step 3: Load Context

Read `AGENTS.md` to understand the project conventions. Follow its documentation-first discovery process: scan `docs/learned/index.md`, grep `docs/learned/` for relevant docs, and load skills as directed by AGENTS.md routing rules.

## Step 4: Explore the Codebase

Use Explore agents and Grep/Glob to understand the relevant areas of the codebase:

- Search for files, patterns, and existing implementations related to the prompt
- Identify which files need to be created or modified
- Understand existing architecture and patterns
- Find relevant tests and test patterns

## Step 5: Write the Plan

Write a comprehensive implementation plan to `.erk/impl-context/plan.md`.

The plan MUST be self-contained for a separate Claude session to implement. Include:

- **Context**: What problem this solves and why
- **Changes**: Specific files to create/modify with detailed descriptions of what to change
- **Implementation details**: Code patterns to follow, key decisions, edge cases
- **Files NOT changing**: Clarify what's out of scope
- **Verification**: How to verify the implementation works

Follow the planning conventions in `docs/learned/planning/` if available.

## Step 6: Generate Plan Summary

Generate a 2-3 sentence summary of the plan you wrote in Step 5. Focus on WHAT the plan does and WHY. Plain text, no markdown formatting. Store the result in `PLAN_SUMMARY`.

## Step 7: Save Plan to GitHub

Check the `$PLAN_ISSUE_NUMBER` environment variable:

**If `$PLAN_ISSUE_NUMBER` is set (non-empty):** A skeleton plan was pre-created at dispatch time. Update it with the real plan content:

```bash
erk exec plan-update --pr-number $PLAN_ISSUE_NUMBER --plan-path .erk/impl-context/plan.md --format json --summary="${PLAN_SUMMARY}"
```

Parse the JSON output. If `success` is not `true`, stop and report the error. Otherwise, use `$PLAN_ISSUE_NUMBER` as the `pr_number`. To get the `title`, extract the first `# ` heading from `.erk/impl-context/plan.md`.

**If `$PLAN_ISSUE_NUMBER` is not set (empty):** Fall back to creating a new planned PR (backwards compatible for direct `erk one-shot` calls without pre-created skeleton):

If the `$OBJECTIVE_ISSUE` environment variable is set (non-empty), create the objective-context marker before saving:

```bash
erk exec marker create --session-id "${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}" --associated-objective $OBJECTIVE_ISSUE objective-context
```

Then run the save command:

```bash
erk exec plan-save --plan-file .erk/impl-context/plan.md --format json --session-id="${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}" --created-from-workflow-run-url "$WORKFLOW_RUN_URL"
```

If the `WORKFLOW_RUN_URL` environment variable is not set, omit the `--created-from-workflow-run-url` flag.

Parse the JSON output. If `success` is not `true`, stop and report the error. Otherwise, extract `pr_number` and `title` from the output.

## Step 8: Write Plan Result

Write the plan result to `.erk/impl-context/plan-result.json` with the following format:

```json
{"pr_number": <num>, "title": "<title>"}
```

Use the `pr_number` and `title` extracted from the Step 7 output.

## Important Notes

- This is planning only — do NOT implement any code changes
- Your outputs are `.erk/impl-context/plan.md` and `.erk/impl-context/plan-result.json`
- The plan must be detailed enough for another agent to implement without additional context
- Keep the plan focused on the prompt
- Never modify CHANGELOG.md
- If after exploring the codebase you determine you cannot produce an actionable plan from the prompt, write `.erk/impl-context/plan-result.json` with `{"rejected": true, "reason": "<explanation>"}` and stop — do not proceed to saving
