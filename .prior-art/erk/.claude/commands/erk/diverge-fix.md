description: Fix branch divergence with remote by rebasing and resolving conflicts

# Diverge Fix

Resolve "Branch X has been updated remotely" errors by reconciling with remote and handling any resulting conflicts.

## Steps

1. **Fetch remote state**

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

2. **Get current branch name**

   ```bash
   BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
   ```

3. **Diagnose divergence** - Understand what changed on each side:

   ```bash
   # Commits only on remote (what we need to incorporate)
   git log --oneline HEAD..origin/$BRANCH

   # Commits only on local (our work that might be lost)
   git log --oneline origin/$BRANCH..HEAD

   # Visual comparison of both
   git log --oneline --left-right --graph HEAD...origin/$BRANCH
   ```

4. **Analyze and decide:**

   | Remote-only commits | Local-only commits | Action                                             |
   | ------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
   | 0                   | 0                  | No divergence - just retry `gt submit`             |
   | 1+                  | 0                  | Fast-forward: `git merge --ff-only origin/$BRANCH` |
   | 0                   | 1+                 | Already ahead (shouldn't trigger this error)       |
   | 1+                  | 1+                 | **Rebase required** - continue to step 5           |

5. **Execute rebase** (when both sides have commits):

   ```bash
   git rebase origin/$BRANCH
   ```

   > **Note:** `gt restack` alone won't fix remote divergence — it only handles parent branch relationships. You need `git rebase origin/$BRANCH` first to sync the PR commits with remote. However, `gt restack` IS needed afterward (step 8) to re-base onto the current parent branch.

6. **If rebase causes conflicts:**

   For each conflicted file:

   a. **Read the file** - Understand both sides of the conflict by examining the conflict markers:
   - `<<<<<<< HEAD` marks the start of your local changes
   - `=======` separates local from incoming changes
   - `>>>>>>> <commit>` marks the end of incoming changes

   b. **Understand intent** - Determine what each side was trying to accomplish:
   - What was the local change trying to do?
   - What was the remote change trying to do?
   - Are they complementary or contradictory?

   c. **Resolve intelligently:**
   - If changes are complementary -> merge both
   - If changes conflict semantically -> prefer the more recent/complete version
   - If unclear -> ask the user for guidance

   d. **Remove all conflict markers** - The resolved file should have no `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, or `>>>>>>>` markers

   e. **Stage the resolution** - `git add <file>`

7. **Re-track branch with Graphite** (when using Graphite):

   The raw `git rebase` in step 5 changed commit SHAs outside Graphite's awareness. Graphite's internal cache (`.graphite_cache_persist`) still points to the old pre-rebase SHAs. Re-track the branch so Graphite recognizes the new commits before restacking:

   ```bash
   gt track
   ```

   > Without this step, `gt restack` will fail with a "diverged from tracking" error because Graphite's cached SHAs no longer match the rebased commits.

8. **Re-restack onto parent branch** (when using Graphite):

   After the rebase resolves the remote divergence, the branch may be based on an older master. Re-restack to ensure the branch sits on top of the current parent:

   ```bash
   gt restack --no-interactive
   ```

   > This is separate from step 5. The `git rebase origin/$BRANCH` in step 5 syncs the PR commits with remote. This `gt restack` ensures the branch base is current master, not the remote's older master.

9. **After successful sync:**
   - For Graphite: `gt submit` (or `gt ss`)
   - For git-only: `git push --force-with-lease`

10. **Verify completion** - Run `git status` and `git log --oneline -5` to confirm sync succeeded

## Edge Cases

### Remote has force-pushed (history rewritten)

If the commit SHAs don't match at all (not just diverged, but completely different):

- This indicates someone rewrote history on remote
- **Ask user** before proceeding - they may want to manually inspect
- Options: hard reset to remote (lose local), or carefully cherry-pick local commits

### Uncommitted local changes

If there are uncommitted changes when starting:

1. Stash changes: `git stash push -m "diverge-fix: uncommitted work"`
2. Perform sync
3. Pop stash: `git stash pop`
4. Handle any stash conflicts

### Multiple branches in stack affected

After syncing one branch, other branches in the stack may need rebasing onto their parents:

1. First: Sync the diverged branch using `git rebase origin/$BRANCH`
2. Then: Run `gt restack --no-interactive` to cascade changes through the stack
3. Conflicts may appear in multiple branches - resolve each in order (downstack to upstack)
