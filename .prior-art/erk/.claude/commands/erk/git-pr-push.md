# Push PR (Git Only)

Automatically create a git commit with a helpful summary message and push the current branch as a pull request using standard git + GitHub CLI (no Graphite required).

## Usage

```bash
# Invoke the command (description argument is optional but recommended)
/erk:git-pr-push "Add user authentication feature"

# Without argument (will analyze changes automatically)
/erk:git-pr-push
```

## What This Command Does

Handles the complete git-only push-pr workflow:

1. Check for uncommitted changes and stage/commit them if needed
2. Analyze git diff to generate meaningful commit message
3. Create commit with AI-generated message
4. Push to origin with upstream tracking
5. Create GitHub PR (or find existing one)
6. Report results with PR URL

## Key Differences from /gt:submit-branch

- Uses standard `git push` instead of `gt submit`
- Uses `gh pr create` instead of Graphite's PR submission
- No stack operations (no restack, no stack metadata updates)
- Simpler workflow: git -> push -> PR (no Graphite layer)
- Works in any git repository (not just Graphite-enabled repos)

## Prerequisites

- Git repository with remote configured
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Run `gh auth status` to verify authentication
- Run `gh auth login` if not authenticated

## Implementation

Execute the git-only push-pr workflow with the following steps:

### Step 1: Verify Prerequisites

Check GitHub CLI authentication and get current git state:

```bash
# Check GitHub CLI authentication (show status for verification)
gh auth status

# Get current branch name
current_branch=$(git branch --show-current)

# Check for uncommitted changes
has_changes=$(git status --porcelain)
```

If `gh auth status` fails, report error and tell user to run `gh auth login`.

### Step 2: Stage Changes (if needed)

If `has_changes` is non-empty, stage all changes:

```bash
git add .
```

### Step 3: Analyze Staged Diff

Get the staged diff and analyze it to generate a commit message:

```bash
# Get repository root for relative paths
repo_root=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)

# Get staged diff for analysis
git diff --staged
```

Load the `erk-diff-analysis` skill for commit message generation guidance.

### Step 4: Add Planned Prefix (if from plan)

If this worktree was created from a plan (an `.erk/impl-context/` subdirectory containing `ref.json` exists), prepend `plnd/` to the PR title:

```bash
if ls .erk/impl-context/*/ref.json 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then
    # Extract the title before creating the commit
    # (we'll apply the prefix when creating the commit message below)
    has_impl_dir=true
else
    has_impl_dir=false
fi
```

When generating the commit message in Step 5, if `has_impl_dir` is true, prepend `plnd/` to the title:

```bash
if [ "$has_impl_dir" = true ]; then
    pr_title="plnd/${pr_title}"
fi
```

### Step 5: Create Commit

Create the commit with your AI-generated message using heredoc:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'COMMIT_MSG'
[Your generated commit message here]
COMMIT_MSG
)"
```

### Step 6: Push to Remote

Push the branch to origin with upstream tracking:

```bash
git push -u origin "$(git branch --show-current)"
```

### Step 7: Check for Existing PR

Before creating a new PR, check if one already exists for the current branch:

```bash
existing_pr=$(gh pr list --head "$(git branch --show-current)" --state open --json number,url,isDraft --jq '.[0]')
```

**Decision logic:**

- If `existing_pr` is empty or null: No existing PR, proceed to Step 8
- If `existing_pr` has data: PR exists, skip Step 8 and go directly to Step 9 (Add Checkout Footer)

> **CRITICAL: When an existing PR is found, do NOT run `gh pr edit --body` or `gh pr edit --title`.**
> The PR body may contain plan-header metadata blocks (`<!-- erk:metadata-block:plan-header -->`)
> that must be preserved. The body will be updated by a later workflow step (`ci-update-pr-body`).
> Only push code (Step 6) and add the checkout footer (Step 9).

If an existing PR was found, extract its details for reporting:

```bash
pr_url=$(echo "$existing_pr" | jq -r '.url')
pr_number=$(echo "$existing_pr" | jq -r '.number')
is_draft=$(echo "$existing_pr" | jq -r '.isDraft')
```

### Step 8: Create GitHub PR (if no existing PR)

**Skip this step if an existing PR was found in Step 7.** The push in Step 6 already updated the existing PR with new commits.

Extract PR title (first line) and body (remaining lines) from commit message:

```bash
# Get the commit message
commit_msg=$(git log -1 --pretty=%B)

# Extract first line as title
pr_title=$(echo "$commit_msg" | head -n 1)

# Extract remaining lines as body (skip empty first line after title)
pr_body=$(echo "$commit_msg" | tail -n +2)

# Create PR using GitHub CLI
pr_output=$(gh pr create --title "$pr_title" --body "$pr_body")

# Extract PR number from the output URL (last path segment)
pr_number=$(echo "$pr_output" | grep -oE '[0-9]+$')
pr_url="$pr_output"
```

### Step 9: Add Checkout Footer

Extract the PR number (from Step 8 if PR was created, or from Step 7 if existing PR was found), then generate and append the checkout footer:

**Determining PR number:**

- If Step 8 was executed: Use `pr_number` extracted from `gh pr create` output
- If Step 8 was skipped: Use `pr_number` extracted from `existing_pr` in Step 7

**Generate and append footer:**

> **Note:** When appending the footer, always read the current body first and append.
> Never replace the entire body — only append the footer to the existing content.

```bash
# Generate footer
footer=$(erk exec get-pr-body-footer --pr-number "$pr_number")

# Get current PR body using REST API (avoids GraphQL rate limits) and append footer
current_body=$(erk exec get-pr-view "$pr_number" | jq -r '.body')
gh pr edit "$pr_number" --body "${current_body}${footer}"
```

**Note:** The footer includes the checkout command. This ensures `erk pr check` passes.

### Step 10: Link PR to Objective (if applicable)

If `ref.json` exists in the resolved impl directory (`.erk/impl-context/<branch>/ref.json`):

```bash
erk exec objective-link-pr --pr-number "$pr_number"
```

If this fails, warn but continue -- PR creation succeeded.

### Step 11: Validate PR Rules

Run the PR check command to validate the PR was created correctly:

```bash
erk pr check
```

This validates:

- PR body contains the standard checkout footer

If any checks fail, display the output and warn the user, but continue to Step 12.

### Step 12: Report Results

Display a clear summary based on whether a PR was created or found:

**If a NEW PR was created (Step 8 was executed):**

```
## Branch Submission Complete

### What Was Done

✓ Staged all uncommitted changes
✓ Created commit with AI-generated message
✓ Pushed branch to origin with upstream tracking
✓ Created GitHub PR

### View PR

[PR URL from gh pr create output]
```

**If an EXISTING PR was found (Step 8 was skipped):**

```
## Branch Submission Complete

### What Was Done

✓ Staged all uncommitted changes
✓ Created commit with AI-generated message
✓ Pushed branch to origin with upstream tracking
✓ Found existing PR #N for this branch (skipped PR creation)

### Note

[If is_draft is true]: This is a draft PR. When ready for review, run: `gh pr ready`

### View PR

[PR URL extracted from existing_pr]
```

**Conditional lines:**

- The "Note" section with draft guidance should only appear if `is_draft` is true

**CRITICAL**: The PR URL MUST be the absolute last line of your output. Do not add any text after it.

## Error Handling

When errors occur, provide clear guidance:

**GitHub CLI not authenticated:**

```
❌ GitHub CLI is not authenticated

To use this command, authenticate with GitHub:
    gh auth login
```

**Nothing to commit:**

```
❌ No changes to commit

Your working directory is clean. Make some changes first.
```

**Push failed (diverged branches):**

```
❌ Push failed: branch has diverged

Option 1: Pull and merge
    git pull origin [branch]

Option 2: Force push (⚠️ overwrites remote)
    git push -f origin [branch]
```

Note: The "PR already exists" case is now handled automatically in Step 7. If a PR exists for the current branch, the command will skip PR creation and report the existing PR URL instead.

## Best Practices

### Never Change Directory

**NEVER use `cd` during execution.** Always use absolute paths or git's `-C` flag.

```bash
# ❌ WRONG
cd /path/to/repo && git status

# ✅ CORRECT
git -C /path/to/repo status
```

**Rationale:** Changing directories pollutes the execution context and makes it harder to reason about state. The working directory should remain stable throughout the entire workflow.

### Never Write to Temporary Files

**NEVER write commit messages or other content to temporary files.** Always use in-context manipulation and shell built-ins.

```bash
# ❌ WRONG - Triggers permission prompts
echo "$message" > "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/commit_msg.txt"
git commit -F "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/commit_msg.txt"

# ✅ CORRECT - In-memory heredoc
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
$message
EOF
)"
```

**Rationale:** Temporary files require filesystem permissions and create unnecessary I/O. Since agents operate in isolated contexts, there's no risk of context pollution from in-memory manipulation.

## Quality Standards

### Always

- Be concise and strategic in analysis
- Use component-level descriptions
- Highlight breaking changes prominently
- Note test coverage patterns
- Use relative paths from repository root
- Provide clear error guidance
- Use standard git + GitHub CLI commands (no Graphite dependencies)

### Never

- Add Claude attribution or footer to commit messages
- Speculate about intentions without code evidence
- Provide exhaustive lists of every function touched
- Include implementation details (specific variable names, line numbers)
- Provide time estimates
- Use vague language like "various changes"
- Retry failed operations automatically
- Write to temporary files (use in-context quoting and shell built-ins instead)
- Use Graphite-specific commands (`gt submit`, `gt restack`, etc.)
