# /erk:pr-address

## Description

Fetches unresolved PR review comments AND PR discussion comments from the current branch's PR and addresses them using holistic analysis with smart batching. Comments are grouped by complexity and relationship, then processed batch-by-batch with incremental commits and resolution.

## Usage

```bash
/erk:pr-address
/erk:pr-address --all               # Include resolved threads (for reference)
/erk:pr-address --pr 6631           # Target specific PR
/erk:pr-address --pr 6631 --all     # Target specific PR with resolved threads
```

## Prerequisite

**Load the `pr-operations` skill first** for complete command reference and common mistake patterns.

## Agent Instructions

> **Plan mode**: If plan mode is active, run Phases 0-2 (mode detection, classify feedback, display batched plan) as normal — these are read-only. Then write the execution plan to the plan file and call ExitPlanMode. Do NOT execute Phases 3-6 (edits, commits, resolution) until plan mode is exited and the user approves. In Plan File Mode, the same applies: run PF-1 and PF-2, then write the plan and call ExitPlanMode before executing PF-3 through PF-6.

> **Prerequisite**: Load `pr-operations` skill first for command reference.

> **CRITICAL: Use ONLY `erk exec` Commands**
>
> See `pr-operations` skill for the complete command reference. Never use raw `gh api` calls for thread operations.

### Phase 0: Mode Detection

Determine the execution mode before any work begins:

1. **Check if `.erk/impl-context/plan.md` is git-tracked**:

   ```bash
   git ls-files --error-unmatch .erk/impl-context/plan.md >/dev/null 2>&1
   ```

   If found → **Plan File Mode** (see below — skip Phases 1-6 entirely)

2. **Otherwise** → **Code Review Mode** (continue to Phase 0.5)

---

### Phase 0.5: Reopen Contested Threads

```bash
erk exec reopen-contested-threads [--pr <number> if specified]
```

If `total_contested > 0`, report: "Reopened N contested threads — these will be included in classification below."
If `success` is false, warn but continue (non-blocking).

---

### Plan File Mode

> **CRITICAL**: In Plan File Mode, you are editing a _document_ — the plan. When a reviewer says "make the language about X more emphatic" or "add a step for Y", you modify the plan _text_. You do NOT make changes to any files described in the plan.

This mode activates when `.erk/impl-context/plan.md` is git-tracked (plan-only PRs). It is a **complete alternative flow** — Phases 1-6 are skipped entirely.

#### PF-1: Classify Feedback

Use the same Task-based classifier as Phase 1:

```
Task(
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  model: "haiku",
  description: "Classify PR feedback",
  prompt: "Load and follow the skill instructions in .claude/skills/pr-feedback-classifier/SKILL.md
           Arguments: [pass through --pr <number> if specified] [--include-resolved if --all was specified]
           Return the complete JSON output as your final message."
)
```

Handle errors and empty comments the same way as Phase 1.

#### PF-2: Display Plan

Show the batched execution plan from the classifier output, same format as Phase 2.

#### PF-3: Execute by Batch

For each batch, follow the same structure as Phase 3 with these constraints:

- **ONLY edit `.erk/impl-context/plan.md`** (and `ref.json` if feedback targets it)
- **Interpret all feedback as "modify the plan text"** — NEVER execute changes the plan describes
- If a reviewer says "add a step to do X", add text to the plan describing step X. Do NOT actually do X.
- Use `git add -f .erk/impl-context/plan.md` for commits (directory is gitignored)

Commit messages follow the same batch format:

```bash
git add -f .erk/impl-context/plan.md
git commit -m "Address plan review comments (batch N/M)

- <summary of comment 1>
- <summary of comment 2>"
```

#### PF-4: Resolve Threads

Same as Phase 4 — resolve all threads via `erk exec resolve-review-threads`.

#### PF-5: Push

Push directly — plan PRs don't use graphite submit:

```bash
git push
```

#### PF-6: Done

Skip `upload-impl-session` — plan PRs have their own formatting and lifecycle.

Report the final summary in the same format as Phase 4's final summary, then stop.

---

### Phase 1: Classify Feedback

Use the Task tool (NOT a `/pr-feedback-classifier` skill invocation) to run the classifier. The skill's `context: fork` metadata does not create true subagent isolation in `--print` mode, so we must use an explicit Task tool call to guarantee the classifier runs in a separate agent context:

```
Task(
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  model: "haiku",
  description: "Classify PR feedback",
  prompt: "Load and follow the skill instructions in .claude/skills/pr-feedback-classifier/SKILL.md
           Arguments: [pass through --pr <number> if specified] [--include-resolved if --all was specified]
           Return the complete JSON output as your final message."
)
```

Parse the JSON response. The skill returns:

- `success`: Whether the operation succeeded
- `pr_number`, `pr_title`, `pr_url`: PR metadata
- `actionable_threads`: Array with `thread_id`, `path`, `line`, `classification`, `action_summary`, `complexity`
  - `classification`: `"actionable"` (code changes needed) or `"informational"` (user decides to act or dismiss)
- `discussion_actions`: Array with `comment_id`, `action_summary`, `complexity`
- `batches`: Execution order with `item_indices` referencing the arrays above
  - Includes an **Informational** batch (last) for `classification: "informational"` threads
- `error`: Error message if `success` is false

**Handle errors**: If `success` is false, display the error and exit.

**Handle no comments**: If both `actionable_threads` and `discussion_actions` are empty, display: "No unresolved review comments or discussion comments on PR #NNN." and exit.

### Phase 2: Display Batched Plan

Show the user the batched execution plan from the classifier output:

```
## Execution Plan

### Batch 1: Local Fixes (3 comments)
| # | Location | Summary |
|---|----------|---------|
| 1 | foo.py:42 | Use LBYL pattern |
| 2 | bar.py:15 | Add type annotation |
| 3 | baz.py:99 | Fix typo |

### Batch 2: Single-File Changes (1 comment)
| # | Location | Summary |
|---|----------|---------|
| 4 | impl.py (multiple) | Rename `old_name` to `new_name` throughout |

### Batch 3: Cross-Cutting Changes (2 comments)
| # | Location | Summary |
|---|----------|---------|
| 5 | Multiple files | Update all callers of deprecated function |
| 6 | docs/ | Update documentation per reviewer request |

### Batch 4: Complex Changes (2 comments -> 1 unified change)
| # | Location | Summary |
|---|----------|---------|
| 7 | impl.py:50 | Fold validate into prepare with union types |
| 8 | cmd.py:100 | (related to #7 - same refactor) |
```

**User confirmation flow:**

- **Batch 1-2 (simple)**: Auto-proceed without confirmation
- **Batch 3-4 (complex)**: Show plan and wait for user approval before executing

### Phase 3: Execute by Batch

For each batch, execute this workflow using the thread IDs from the classifier JSON:

#### Pre-Existing Batch (Special Handling)

If the batch has `complexity: "pre_existing"`, handle it differently — no code changes, no CI, no commit:

1. Resolve all threads in the batch via `erk exec resolve-review-threads` with a standard comment:

```bash
echo '[{"thread_id": "PRRT_abc", "comment": "Pre-existing issue — this code was moved/restructured, not newly introduced."}, ...]' | erk exec resolve-review-threads
```

2. Report progress:

```
## Batch 0: Pre-Existing (Auto-Resolve)

Auto-resolved N pre-existing threads (bot comments on moved/restructured code).
No code changes needed.
```

3. Continue to the next batch. Skip Steps 1-5 below for this batch.

#### Step 1: Address All Comments in the Batch

For each comment in the batch:

**For Informational Review Threads** (`classification: "informational"`):

Present the user with a choice using AskUserQuestion:

- **Act**: Make the suggested change, then resolve the thread
- **Dismiss**: Resolve the thread without code changes (reply with a brief message like "Acknowledged, not acting on this suggestion")

If the user chooses **Act**, proceed as a normal review thread (read file, make fix, track change). If the user chooses **Dismiss**, skip to Step 4 to resolve the thread with a dismissal reply.

**For Actionable Review Threads** (`classification: "actionable"`):

1. Read the file to understand context:
   - If `line` is specified: Read around that line number
   - If `line` is null (outdated thread): Read the entire file or search for relevant code mentioned in the comment
2. Make the fix following the reviewer's feedback
3. Track the change for the batch commit message

**For Discussion Comments:**

1. Determine if action is needed:
   - If it's a request (e.g., "Please update docs"), take the requested action
   - If it's a question, provide an answer or make clarifying changes
   - If it's architectural feedback/suggestion, investigate the codebase to understand implications
   - If it's just acknowledgment/thanks, note it and move on
2. **Investigate the codebase** when the comment requires understanding existing code:
   - Search for relevant patterns, existing implementations, or related code
   - Note any interesting findings that inform your decision
   - Record these findings - they become permanent documentation in the reply
3. Take action if needed

**Handling False Positives from Automated Reviewers:**

Automated review bots (like `dignified-python-review`, linters, or security scanners) can flag false positives. Before making code changes:

1. **Read the flagged code carefully** - understand what the bot is complaining about
2. **Verify if it's a false positive** by checking:
   - Is the pattern the bot wants already implemented nearby? (e.g., LBYL check already exists on a preceding line)
   - Is the bot misunderstanding the code structure?
   - Is the bot applying a rule that doesn't fit this specific context?
3. **If it's a false positive**, do NOT make unnecessary code changes. Instead:
   - Reply to the comment explaining why it's a false positive
   - Reference specific line numbers where the correct pattern already exists
   - Resolve the thread

**For Outdated Review Threads** (`is_outdated: true`):

Outdated threads have `line: null` because the code has changed since the comment was made.

1. **Read the file** at the path (ignore line number - search for relevant code)
2. **Check if the issue is already fixed** in the current code
3. **Take action:**
   - If already fixed -> Proceed directly to Step 4 to resolve the thread
   - If not fixed -> Apply the fix, then proceed to Step 4

**IMPORTANT**: Outdated threads MUST still be resolved via `erk exec resolve-review-thread`.
Do not skip resolution just because no code change was needed.

#### Step 2: Run CI Checks

After making all changes in the batch:

```bash
# Run relevant CI checks for changed files
# (This may vary by project - use project's test commands)
```

If CI fails, fix the issues before proceeding.

#### Step 3: Commit the Batch

Create a single commit for all changes in the batch:

```bash
git add <changed files>
git commit -m "Address PR review comments (batch N/M)

- <summary of comment 1>
- <summary of comment 2>
..."
```

**Note:** If any changed files are in `.erk/impl-context/` (plan-only PRs), use `git add -f` instead — the directory is gitignored.

#### Step 4: Resolve All Threads in the Batch (MANDATORY)

**This step is NOT optional.** Every thread must be resolved using the thread IDs from the classifier JSON.

After committing, resolve review threads and mark discussion comments.

**For Review Threads** - use the batch command `erk exec resolve-review-threads` to resolve all review threads in a single call. Pipe a JSON array via stdin:

```bash
echo '[{"thread_id": "PRRT_abc", "comment": "Fixed in commit abc1234"}, {"thread_id": "PRRT_def", "comment": "Applied suggestion"}]' | erk exec resolve-review-threads
```

Each item has `thread_id` (required) and `comment` (optional). Build the JSON array from the batch's thread IDs and resolution messages, then pipe it in one call.

**For Discussion Comments** - use `erk exec reply-to-discussion-comment` with the `comment_id` from the JSON, with a substantive reply that quotes the original comment and explains what action was taken.

#### Step 5: Report Progress

After completing the batch, report:

```
## Batch N Complete

Addressed:
- foo.py:42 - Used LBYL pattern
- bar.py:15 - Added type annotation

Committed: abc1234 "Address PR review comments (batch 1/3)"

Resolved threads: 2
Remaining batches: 2
```

Then proceed to the next batch.

### Phase 4: Final Verification

After all batches complete, re-invoke the classifier to verify all threads are resolved. Use Task tool (NOT skill invocation) for the same `--print` mode isolation reason as Phase 1:

```
Task(
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  model: "haiku",
  description: "Verify PR feedback resolved",
  prompt: "Load and follow the skill instructions in .claude/skills/pr-feedback-classifier/SKILL.md
           Arguments: [pass through --pr <number> if originally specified]
           Return the complete JSON output as your final message."
)
```

If `actionable_threads` or `discussion_actions` are non-empty, warn about remaining unresolved items. Both `actionable` and `informational` classified threads should be resolved (either by code changes or by dismissal).

#### Report Final Summary

```
## All PR Comments Addressed

Total comments: 8
Pre-existing (auto-resolved): 3
Actionable (code changes): 5
Batches: 4
Commits: 3

All review threads resolved.
All discussion comments marked with reaction.

Next steps:
1. Push changes:
   - **Graphite repos**: `gt submit` (or `gt ss`)
   - **Plain git repos**: `git push`
   - If push is rejected (non-fast-forward): Run `/erk:diverge-fix` to resolve. Do NOT use `git pull --rebase`.
2. Wait for CI to pass
3. Request re-review if needed
```

#### Handle Any Skipped Comments

If the user explicitly skipped any comments during the process, list them:

```
## Skipped Comments (user choice)
- #5: src/legacy.py:100 - "Refactor this module" (user deferred)
```

### Phase 5: Upload Address Session

After addressing review comments, upload the session for cross-machine learning.
Resolve the pr_id from the current branch, then push the session:

```bash
erk exec upload-impl-session --session-id "${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}" 2>/dev/null || true
```

This is non-critical — if it fails (no plan tracking, no session found), addressing was still successful.

### Common Mistakes

See `pr-operations` skill for the complete table of common mistakes and correct approaches.

### Error Handling

**No PR for branch:** Display error and suggest creating a PR with `gt create` or `gh pr create`

**GitHub API error:** Display error and suggest checking `gh auth status` and repository access

**CI failure during batch:** Stop, display the failure, and let the user decide whether to fix and continue or abort
