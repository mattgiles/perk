# /erk:objective-plan

Create an implementation plan for a specific node in an objective's dependency graph.

## Usage

```bash
/erk:objective-plan 3679
/erk:objective-plan 3679 --node 2.1
/erk:objective-plan 3679 --node 3.1 --node 3.2
/erk:objective-plan https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/3679
/erk:objective-plan  # prompts for objective reference
```

## Agent Instructions

### Step 0: Check for Known Node (Fast Path)

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for one or more `--node <node-id>` flags. If at least one `--node` is present along with an issue number:

1. Run `/erk:objective-reconcile <objective-number>` via the Skill tool.
2. Then invoke the inner skill via the Skill tool, passing all `--node` flags through:

```
/erk:system:objective-plan-node <objective-number> --node <node-id-1> [--node <node-id-2> ...]
```

Examples:

- Single node: `/erk:system:objective-plan-node 3679 --node 2.1`
- Multiple nodes: `/erk:system:objective-plan-node 3679 --node 3.1 --node 3.2 --node 3.3`

This skips the interactive selection flow (Steps 1-4 below) since the node(s) are already known. The inner skill handles marker creation, marking as planning, context gathering, plan mode, and saving.

**STOP here** — do not proceed to the steps below.

### Step 1: Resolve Objective Reference

Strip `--node` from `$ARGUMENTS` if present, then run:

```bash
erk exec resolve-objective-ref $ARGUMENTS
```

**Interpret the JSON result:**

- If `"resolved": true` with `"source": "branch_name"` or `"source": "plan_metadata"`: Inform user "Using objective #N from {source}. Run with explicit argument to override."
- If `"resolved": true` with `"source": "argument"`: Use the `objective_number` directly.
- If `"resolved": false`: Use AskUserQuestion to ask "What objective issue should I work from?"

### Step 2: Fetch and Set Up Objective Context

Run:

```bash
erk exec objective-plan-setup <objective-number> --session-id "${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}"
```

**Interpret the JSON result:**

- If `"success": false` with `"error": "not_found"`: Report error and exit.
- If `"success": false` with `"error": "is_plan"`: Redirect to `/erk:plan-implement`.
- If `"success": false` with `"error": "validation_error"`: Report error and exit.
- If `"success": true`: Continue with the roadmap data.

Display any `"warnings"` to the user.

### Step 2.5: Reconcile Objective

Invoke `/erk:objective-reconcile <objective-number>` via the Skill tool.

This audits the objective against the current codebase, identifies stale references
and nodes completed outside the erk land workflow, and applies updates with user
confirmation before proceeding to node selection.

If reconciliation finds no issues, it reports "all references current" and continues.
If it finds and fixes issues, the roadmap displayed in Step 4 will reflect the
updated state.

### Step 3: Load Objective Skill

Load the `objective` skill for format templates and guidance.

### Step 4: Display Roadmap and Prompt User

Display the roadmap table from the `roadmap.phases` data in the JSON output.

Then use AskUserQuestion to ask which node to plan:

```
Which node should I create a plan for?
- Node 1A.1: <description> (Recommended) ← first pending node without plan in progress
- Node 1A.2: <description>
- Node 2B.1: <description> (plan in progress, #456) ← shown but not recommended
- (Other - specify node number or description)
```

**Filtering rules (based on node `status` field from phases):**

- **Show as options:** Nodes with status `"pending"`
- **Show but deprioritize:** Nodes with status `"in_progress"` - still selectable via "Other" but not recommended
- **Hide from options:** Nodes with status `"done"`, `"blocked"`, or `"skipped"`

**Recommendation rule:** Use `roadmap.next_node` from the JSON as the recommended option. If `next_node` is null, no node is recommended.

If all nodes are complete or have plans in progress, report appropriately:

- All complete: "All roadmap nodes are complete! Consider closing the objective."
- All have plans: "All pending nodes have plans in progress. You can still select one via 'Other' to create a parallel plan."

### Step 5: Invoke Inner Skill

After the user selects a node or nodes, invoke the inner skill via the Skill tool:

```
/erk:system:objective-plan-node <objective-number> --node <node-id-1> [--node <node-id-2> ...]
```

If the user selects a phase with multiple nodes (e.g., "Phase 3 (nodes 3.1-3.5)"), pass all selected node IDs as separate `--node` flags.

The inner skill handles marker creation, marking as planning, context gathering, plan mode, and saving. **STOP here** — the inner skill takes over.

## Output Format

- **Start:** "Loading objective #<number>..."
- **After parsing:** Display roadmap nodes with status
- **After selection:** "Creating plan for node <step-id>: <description>"
- **In plan mode:** Show plan content
- **End:** Always proceed with `/erk:plan-save` — do not offer direct implementation

## Error Cases

| Scenario                                | Action                                                           |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Objective not found                     | Report error and exit                                            |
| Reference is erk-pr                     | Redirect to `/erk:plan-implement`                                |
| No pending nodes                        | Report all nodes complete, suggest closing                       |
| Invalid argument format                 | Prompt for valid issue number                                    |
| Roadmap not parseable                   | Ask user to specify which node to plan                           |
| Verification fails (no objective_issue) | `/erk:plan-save` handles automatically; follow remediation steps |

## Important Notes

- **Objective context matters:** Read the full objective for design decisions and lessons learned
- **Plans can target one or multiple nodes:** Single node is typical; multi-node is supported for related steps in the same phase
- **Link back:** Always reference the parent objective in the plan
- **Steelthread pattern:** If planning a Phase A node, focus on minimal vertical slice

## Post-Plan Behavior

**CRITICAL: Objective plans must ALWAYS be saved as PRs.** When the exit-plan-mode hook presents save-or-implement options, ALWAYS proceed with "Create a plan PR" by running `/erk:plan-save`. Do NOT offer to implement directly — objective node plans require PR tracking for the objective's roadmap status to work correctly.
