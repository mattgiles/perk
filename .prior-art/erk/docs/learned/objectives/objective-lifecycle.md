# Objective Lifecycle

This document describes the complete lifecycle of objective issues from creation to closure, including all mutation paths and data flows.

## Overview

Objectives are GitHub issues with the `erk-objective` label that track multi-plan work through a roadmap structure. The roadmap exists in two forms:

1. **Source of truth**: YAML frontmatter in `<!-- erk:metadata-block:objective-roadmap -->` blocks (in issue body)
2. **Rendered view**: Markdown table in the objective-body comment (for human readability)

All objectives use v2 YAML format. `parse_roadmap()` returns a legacy-format error for non-v2 content. Mutations update both the YAML frontmatter and the rendered table atomically via `update-objective-node`.

## Objective States

Objectives have an implicit state machine based on roadmap step completion:

```
Created → Active → Complete → Closed
```

- **Created**: Objective exists with roadmap, no steps done
- **Active**: At least one step in progress, planning, or done
- **Complete**: All steps are done or skipped (terminal step statuses)
- **Closed**: Issue is closed (manually or automatically)

### Step-Level States

Individual roadmap steps follow this lifecycle:

```
pending → planning → in_progress → done
                                  → skipped
          → blocked (from any non-terminal state)
```

- **pending**: Work not started
- **planning**: Step dispatched for autonomous planning (draft PR created via `erk objective plan`)
- **in_progress**: Active implementation underway
- **done**: PR landed
- **blocked**: External dependency prevents progress
- **skipped**: Step determined unnecessary

## Creation

Objectives are created through:

1. **Manual creation**: User runs `gh issue create` with `erk-objective` label and roadmap markdown
2. **Assisted creation**: User runs `erk objective create` (slash command) which guides through structured input

### Initial Roadmap Format

When created, objectives have:

- Phase headers: `### Phase N: Name` or `### Phase NA: Name`
- Markdown table with columns: Step | Description | Status | PR
- All steps start with status `pending` and no PR

**Example:**

```markdown
# Objective: Build Authentication System

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation

| Node | Description     | Status  | PR  |
| ---- | --------------- | ------- | --- |
| 1.1  | Add user model  | pending | -   |
| 1.2  | Add JWT library | pending | -   |

### Phase 2: Implementation

| Node | Description     | Status  | PR  |
| ---- | --------------- | ------- | --- |
| 2.1  | Implement login | pending | -   |
```

**With frontmatter (preferred):**

```markdown
## <!-- erk:metadata-block:objective-roadmap -->

schema_version: "2"
steps:

- id: "1.1"
  description: "Add user model"
  status: "pending"
  pr: null
- id: "1.2"
  description: "Add JWT library"
  status: "pending"
  pr: null
- id: "2.1"
  description: "Implement login"
  status: "pending"
  pr: null

---

<!-- /erk:metadata-block:objective-roadmap -->

## Roadmap

[same markdown table as above]
```

## Reading

All roadmap reads go through `parse_roadmap(body: str)` in `erk_shared.gateway.github.metadata.roadmap` (`packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/github/metadata/roadmap.py`).

### Parsing Flow

```
parse_roadmap(body)
  ↓
  Check for objective-roadmap metadata block
  ↓
  ├─ Block found + valid YAML?
  │  ↓
  │  parse_roadmap_frontmatter()
  │  → group_nodes_by_phase()
  │  → enrich_phase_names()
  │  → Return (phases, [])
  │
  ├─ Block found + invalid YAML?
  │  → Return ([], [legacy_format_error])
  │
  └─ No block at all?
     → Return ([], [])  ← valid roadmap-free objective
```

### Three-Case Distinction

1. **No `objective-roadmap` block** → valid roadmap-free objective. Returns `([], [])` with no errors.
2. **Block parses successfully** → normal objective with roadmap phases.
3. **Block exists but fails to parse** → legacy/broken format. Returns `([], [legacy_format_error])`.

This distinction matters for `validate_objective()` in `check_cmd.py`: when no roadmap block exists, it reports "Roadmap: none (objective has no roadmap)" as a passing check and skips checks 3-7 (all roadmap-dependent). The `erk objective view` command displays "No roadmap data found" for roadmap-free objectives.

<!-- Source: packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/github/metadata/roadmap.py, parse_roadmap -->

**Source:** See `parse_roadmap()` in `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/github/metadata/roadmap.py`

There is no table-parsing fallback. Non-v2 content returns an empty phases list with a legacy format error message directing users to recreate the objective.

### Status Resolution

Status comes directly from the YAML `status` field in frontmatter — no inference from the PR column during parsing.

- Phase names extracted from markdown headers via `enrich_phase_names()` (not stored in YAML)
- Phase membership derived from step ID prefix (e.g., "1.2" → phase 1)

## Mutations

Mutations update YAML frontmatter in the issue body (source of truth) and the markdown table in the objective-body comment (rendered view). Both are updated atomically by `update-objective-node`.

### Mutation Sites

| Site                                     | Type      | Trigger                                              | Updates                            | Frontmatter-Aware?              |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `update-objective-node.py`               | Surgical  | `erk exec update-objective-node` or `/erk:plan-save` | YAML frontmatter + table comment   | Yes (this plan)                 |
| `system:objective-update-with-landed-pr` | Full-body | After landing PR                                     | Roadmap + prose sections           | Yes (this plan)                 |
| `objective-update-with-closed-plan`      | Full-body | After closing affiliated plan                        | Roadmap (reset to pending) + prose | Yes (this plan)                 |
| `plan-save.md` Step 3.5                  | Indirect  | Creating plan from objective                         | Calls `update-objective-node`      | Inherits                        |
| `check_cmd.py` / `validate_objective()`  | Read-only | `erk objective check`                                | N/A (reads only)                   | Inherits from `parse_roadmap()` |
| `objective_fetch_context.py`             | Read-only | Fetch context for updates                            | N/A (reads only)                   | Inherits from `parse_roadmap()` |

### Surgical Update: `update-objective-node`

**Path**: `src/erk/cli/commands/exec/scripts/update_objective_node.py`

**What it does**: Updates a single step's PR reference and recomputes status.

**Mutation flow**:

1. Fetch issue body
2. Check for `objective-roadmap` metadata block
3. Parse YAML frontmatter, find step by ID
4. Update `pr` field and recompute `status`
5. Serialize back to YAML and replace metadata block in body
6. Write updated body to GitHub
7. Also update markdown table in objective-body comment (v2 rendered view)

**Usage**:

```bash
erk exec update-objective-node 6423 --node 1.3 --pr "#6500"
erk exec update-objective-node 6423 --node 1.3 --pr "#6500" --status done
erk exec update-objective-node 6423 --node 1.3 --pr ""  # Clear
```

**Status computation**:

- Explicit `--status` provided → use it directly
- PR is set (no explicit status) → status = `in_progress`
- Neither → preserve existing status

### Full-Body Update: `system:objective-update-with-landed-pr`

**Path**: `.claude/commands/erk/system/objective-update-with-landed-pr.md`

**What it does**: Updates objective after landing a PR. Marks steps as done, posts action comment, reconciles stale prose sections.

**Mutation flow**:

1. Determine which steps the PR completed (compare plan to roadmap)
2. Compose action comment with summary and lessons learned
3. **Compose updated objective body:**
   - Parse YAML frontmatter
   - Update relevant step(s): set `pr: "#<number>"` and `status: "done"`
   - Serialize updated YAML and replace metadata block
   - Also update markdown table in objective-body comment
   - Reconcile stale prose sections (Design Decisions, Implementation Context)
4. Post action comment to GitHub
5. Write updated body to GitHub
6. Check if all steps are done/skipped → close objective if complete

**Agent workflow**: Single-agent pattern. Agent fetches context, then performs all updates directly (roadmap steps, prose reconciliation, action comment, validation).

### Node Description Reconciliation

When a plan's implementation diverges from the original node description (e.g., the node says `@json_output` but the PR implemented `@json_command`), this is a "naming divergence" contradiction. The description must be updated to reflect what was actually built.

**Workflow**: Update node descriptions BEFORE prose updates, because comment re-rendering uses the current descriptions:

```bash
erk exec update-objective-node <objective_number> --node <node_id> --description "<corrected description>"
```

This is treated as documentation correction after the fact — not a failure. The roadmap should be a source of truth for _what exists_, not just _what was intended_.

**Source**: `.claude/commands/erk/system/objective-update-with-landed-pr.md` (reconciliation guidance in Step 2)

### Indirect Updates

#### `/erk:plan-save` Step 3.5

When saving a plan that's part of an objective:

- Calls `erk exec update-objective-node <objective> --node <step-id> --pr "" --status in_progress`
- Inherits frontmatter support from `update-objective-node`

## Frontmatter Format

All objectives use v2 YAML frontmatter. Legacy table-only objectives are no longer supported by the parser.

### Frontmatter Schema

```yaml
---
schema_version: "2"
steps:
  - id: "1.1" # Required: step identifier
    description: "..." # Required: human-readable description
    status: "pending" # Required: pending|planning|done|in_progress|blocked|skipped
    pr: null # Optional: null or string like "#123" (PR number)
---
```

**Design decisions**:

- **Flat list**: Steps are stored flat, phase membership derived from ID prefix
- **No phase names**: Phase names live only in markdown headers (extracted at read time)
- **Schema versioning**: `schema_version` for future evolution
- **Explicit status**: No inference in frontmatter (unlike tables)

### Frontmatter and Table Relationship

- **Frontmatter** (in issue body) = source of truth for step data
- **Table** (in objective-body comment) = rendered view for human readability
- Mutations update both atomically via `update-roadmap-step`
- Reads use frontmatter only — table is never parsed

## Body Reconciliation

Objective body sections fall into three tiers based on how they're updated:

| Tier             | Sections                                                    | Owner             | Updated When                      |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Mechanical**   | Roadmap status/PR cells                                     | Exec commands     | Plan assigned / PR landed         |
| **Reconcilable** | Design Decisions, Implementation Context, step descriptions | LLM agent         | After PR overrides what's written |
| **Immutable**    | Exploration Notes                                           | Agent at creation | Never (historical artifact)       |

### When Reconciliation Happens

1. **After every PR landing** (primary trigger): The `system:objective-update-with-landed-pr` agent performs prose reconciliation after mechanical step updates. It compares the objective body against what the PR actually implemented and corrects stale information.

1. **After plan closure** (secondary trigger): The `objective-update-with-closed-plan` agent resets affiliated nodes to pending and reconciles prose that referenced the abandoned plan's approach.

1. **At next-step pickup** (lighter touch): When `objective-plan` runs, the agent scans the objective body for context that may be stale from other work in the codebase.

### What the Agent Checks

The agent reads the objective body (post-mechanical-update) and the PR title/description/plan, looking for:

- **Decision overrides**: Objective says one approach, PR implemented another
- **Scope changes**: Step description doesn't match what was actually built
- **Architecture drift**: Implementation Context describes files/patterns that moved or changed
- **Constraint invalidation**: Requirements that are no longer valid
- **New discoveries**: Insights that affect future steps

### How Reconciliation Is Reported

Action comments gain an optional **Body Reconciliation** subsection (after Roadmap Updates) documenting what changed. If nothing is stale, the subsection is omitted entirely.

## Closing

Objectives close when:

1. All roadmap steps are `done` or `skipped`
2. User confirms closure (unless `--auto-close` flag present)
3. `gh issue close <issue-number>` is executed

**Closure triggers**:

- `/erk:system:objective-update-with-landed-pr` checks completion after each PR lands
- Manual: `erk objective close <issue>` (future command)

**Closure comment format**:

```markdown
## Action: Objective Complete

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

All roadmap steps completed:

- N total steps
- N done
- N skipped

[Summary of what was accomplished]
```

## Read-Only Consumers

These components read roadmap data but don't mutate:

| Consumer                     | Purpose                         |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `check_cmd.py`               | Validate objective structure    |
| `objective_fetch_context.py` | Fetch objective/plan/PR context |
| `objective_list.py`          | List all objectives             |
| TUI viewers                  | Display objective state         |

All read-only consumers use `parse_roadmap()` which reads v2 YAML frontmatter.

## Context Fetching: objective-fetch-context

**Path:** `src/erk/cli/commands/exec/scripts/objective_fetch_context.py`

The `objective-fetch-context` exec script bundles all context needed for objective updates into a single JSON response, eliminating multiple sequential data-fetching turns.

### Auto-Discovery Mode

All three flags are optional. When omitted, arguments are discovered from git state:

```bash
erk exec objective-fetch-context                          # full auto-discovery
erk exec objective-fetch-context --pr 6517 --objective 6423 --branch P6513-...
```

**Discovery chain:**

1. **Branch**: from current git state via `git.branch.get_current_branch()`
2. **Plan number**: extracted from branch name via regex `^P(\d+)-`
3. **Objective**: extracted from plan metadata (`plan-header.objective_issue` field)
4. **PR number**: discovered from branch via `github.get_pr_for_branch()`

### Explicit Node Selection

When landing a PR, the caller explicitly specifies which nodes were completed via `--node` flags on `objective-apply-landed-update`. There is no automatic matching — the agent or skill decides which nodes a PR implements.

### Output Format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "objective": {"number": 6423, "title": "...", "body": "..."},
  "plan": {"number": 6513, "title": "...", "body": "..."},
  "pr": {"number": 6517, "title": "...", "body": "..."},
  "roadmap": {
    "phases": [...],
    "summary": "...",
    "next_node": "1.3",
    "all_complete": false
  }
}
```

## Auto-Selection: --next Flag on objective plan

**Path:** `src/erk/cli/commands/objective/plan_cmd.py`

The `--next` flag auto-selects the next unblocked pending node using dependency graph traversal:

```bash
erk objective plan 42 --next          # explicit objective
erk objective plan --next             # infers objective from current branch
erk objective plan --next --one-shot  # auto-select + dispatch remotely
```

**Resolution logic**:

1. If issue_ref provided, use it directly
2. Otherwise, infer objective from current branch via `get_objective_for_branch()`
3. Build `DependencyGraph` via `graph_from_phases()`
4. Traverse the dependency graph to find the first unblocked pending node

Returns a `ResolvedNext` frozen dataclass with `issue_number`, `node`, and `phase_name`.

**Mutual exclusion**: `--next` and `--node` cannot be used together.

## Action Comments: objective-post-action-comment

**Path:** `src/erk/cli/commands/exec/scripts/objective_post_action_comment.py`

Posts formatted action comments to objective issues after PR landing. Reads structured JSON from stdin:

```json
{
  "issue_number": 6423,
  "date": "2026-02-17",
  "pr_number": 6517,
  "phase_step": "1.1, 1.2",
  "title": "Brief title",
  "what_was_done": ["Action 1", "Action 2"],
  "lessons_learned": ["Insight 1"],
  "roadmap_updates": ["Step 1.1: pending -> done"],
  "body_reconciliation": [
    { "section": "Design Decisions", "change": "Updated X" }
  ]
}
```

Required fields: `issue_number`, `date`, `pr_number`, `phase_step`, `title`, `what_was_done`. Body reconciliation section is omitted from output when empty.
