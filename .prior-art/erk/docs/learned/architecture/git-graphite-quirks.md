# Git and Graphite Edge Cases Catalog

This document catalogs surprising edge cases and quirks discovered when working with git and Graphite (gt). Each entry includes the discovery context, the surprising behavior, and the workaround.

## Rebase Cleanup Without Completion (Issue #2844)

**Surprising Behavior**: When `gt continue` runs after conflict resolution but conflicts weren't fully resolved, the rebase-merge directory gets cleaned up BUT:

- `is_rebase_in_progress()` returns `False` (no `.git/rebase-merge` or `.git/rebase-apply` dirs)
- `is_worktree_clean()` returns `False` (unmerged files still exist)
- HEAD becomes detached (pointing to commit hash, not branch)

**Why It's Surprising**: One might assume that if `.git/rebase-merge/` doesn't exist, the rebase either completed successfully or was aborted. This is NOT true - it can be in a "half-finished" broken state.

**Detection Pattern**:

```python
# WRONG: Assuming no rebase dirs = clean state
if not git.rebase_ops.is_rebase_in_progress(cwd):
    # Might still have unmerged files!
    pass

# CORRECT: Check for unmerged files explicitly
status_result = subprocess.run(
    ["git", "-C", str(cwd), "status", "--porcelain"],
    capture_output=True, text=True, check=False,
)
unmerged_prefixes = ("UU", "AA", "DD", "AU", "UA", "DU", "UD")
unmerged_files = [
    line[3:] for line in status_lines if line[:2] in unmerged_prefixes
]
```

**Location in Codebase**: `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/gt/operations/`

## Transient Dirty State After Rebase

**Surprising Behavior**: After `gt restack --no-interactive` completes, there can be a brief window where `is_worktree_clean()` returns `False` due to:

- Graphite metadata files being written/cleaned up
- Git rebase temp files not yet removed
- File system sync delays

**Workaround**: Retry with brief delay (100ms) before failing.

```python
if not git.worktree.is_worktree_clean(cwd):
    time.sleep(0.1)  # Brief delay for transient files
    if not git.worktree.is_worktree_clean(cwd):
        # Now it's actually dirty - handle error
        ...
```

**Location in Codebase**: `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/gt/operations/`

## Unmerged File Status Codes

**Reference**: Git status porcelain format for unmerged files

| Code | Meaning                                |
| ---- | -------------------------------------- |
| `UU` | Both modified (classic merge conflict) |
| `AA` | Both added                             |
| `DD` | Both deleted                           |
| `AU` | Added by us, unmerged                  |
| `UA` | Added by them, unmerged                |
| `DU` | Deleted by us, unmerged                |
| `UD` | Deleted by them, unmerged              |

All indicate files needing manual resolution before the rebase can continue.

## Detached HEAD Detection

**Pattern**: Check if HEAD is detached (not pointing to a branch):

```python
symbolic_result = subprocess.run(
    ["git", "-C", str(cwd), "symbolic-ref", "-q", "HEAD"],
    capture_output=True, text=True, check=False,
)
is_detached = symbolic_result.returncode != 0
```

`git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` returns "HEAD" when detached, but using `symbolic-ref` is more explicit.

## Git Index Lock and Worktree Concurrency

**Background**: Git's index and `index.lock` are **per-worktree**, not repository-wide. Each worktree has its own index stored in its admin directory (e.g., `.git/worktrees/<id>/index`).

**What IS shared across worktrees:**

- Objects (the object database)
- Refs (branch pointers, tags)
- Ref lockfiles (e.g., when updating the same branch from multiple worktrees)

**What is NOT shared:**

- Index and index.lock (each worktree has its own)
- HEAD (each worktree tracks its own checked-out branch)
- Other per-worktree files

**Gitfile Indirection**: Linked worktrees use gitfile indirection (not sparse checkout):

- Each worktree has `.git` as a **file** (not a directory)
- The file contains: `gitdir: /main/repo/.git/worktrees/<name>`
- The worktree's admin directory contains `index`, `HEAD`, and a `commondir` file pointing to the shared repo

**Robust Lock File Resolution**:

Use `git rev-parse --git-path` to let Git resolve paths correctly for any layout:

```python
import subprocess
from pathlib import Path

def git_path(repo_root: Path, rel: str) -> Path:
    """Let Git resolve the correct path for this worktree."""
    out = subprocess.check_output(
        ["git", "-C", str(repo_root), "rev-parse", "--git-path", rel],
        text=True,
    ).strip()
    return Path(out)

def wait_for_index_lock(repo_root: Path, time: Time, *, max_wait_seconds: float = 5.0) -> bool:
    """Wait for index.lock to be released."""
    lock_file = git_path(repo_root, "index.lock")
    elapsed = 0.0
    while lock_file.exists() and elapsed < max_wait_seconds:
        time.sleep(0.5)
        elapsed += 0.5
    return not lock_file.exists()
```

This handles all cases:

- Normal repos (`.git` directory)
- Linked worktrees (`.git` file → per-worktree admin dir)
- Uncommon layouts (`$GIT_DIR`, `$GIT_COMMON_DIR`)

**Anti-Pattern**: Don't manually parse `.git` files and compute paths with `parent.parent`. The worktree admin directory structure can vary, and Git uses `commondir` files for indirection.

**When to Use**: Apply lock-waiting to operations that modify the index (`checkout`, `add`, `commit`, `reset`, etc.) when running concurrent git commands in the same worktree or when updating shared refs across worktrees.

**Implementation Reference**: `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/git/lock.py`

## Graphite Interactive Mode Hangs

**Surprising Behavior**: Running `gt sync`, `gt submit`, `gt restack`, or other gt commands without the `--no-interactive` flag can cause the command to hang indefinitely when run from Claude Code sessions or other non-interactive contexts.

**Why It's Surprising**: The command appears to be doing nothing - no output, no error, just silence. The underlying cause is that gt is waiting for user input at a prompt that isn't visible.

**Solution**: Always use `--no-interactive` flag with gt commands:

```bash
# WRONG - may hang waiting for user input
gt sync
gt submit
gt submit --force  # --force does NOT prevent prompts!

# CORRECT - never prompts, fails fast if interaction needed
gt sync --no-interactive
gt submit --no-interactive
gt submit --force --no-interactive
gt restack --no-interactive
```

**Important**: The `--force` flag does NOT prevent interactive prompts. You must use `--no-interactive` separately. The `--force` flag only skips confirmation for destructive operations, but gt may still prompt for other decisions (like whether to include upstack branches).

**Common Scenarios Where gt Prompts**:

- `gt sync` prompts to delete merged branches
- `gt submit` prompts to confirm PR creation/update
- `gt restack` prompts during conflict resolution
- Various commands prompt when state is ambiguous

**Implementation Reference**: This pattern is used throughout the Graphite gateway in `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/graphite/real.py`.

## Graphite track_branch Remote Ref Limitation

**Surprising Behavior**: Graphite's `gt track --parent <branch>` command **only accepts local branch names** (e.g., `main`), not remote refs (e.g., `origin/main`). Git commands like `git branch` and `git checkout` accept both transparently, but Graphite will reject remote refs or create incorrect parent relationships.

**Why It's Surprising**: Git and Graphite are often used together, and Git's flexibility with branch references creates an expectation that Graphite would also accept remote refs. The error messages from Graphite don't clearly indicate that the issue is the `origin/` prefix.

**Solution**: The `GraphiteBranchManager.create_branch()` method normalizes branch names before calling `graphite_branch_ops.track_branch()`. It strips the `origin/` prefix and ensures the local parent matches remote before tracking.

**Design Pattern**: Tool quirks should be absorbed at abstraction boundaries. Callers (like the submit command) don't need to know about Graphite's limitations -- they can pass remote refs freely and trust `BranchManager` to handle normalization.

**Anti-Pattern**: Calling `graphite_branch_ops.track_branch()` directly with user-provided branch names that might contain `origin/` prefix.

**Location in Codebase**: `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/branch_manager/graphite.py`

## Parent Branch Divergence Detection

**Surprising Behavior**: When creating a new branch from a remote ref (e.g., `origin/feature-parent`) and the corresponding local branch `feature-parent` exists but has different commits, Graphite's `gt track` can succeed but create an invalid stack relationship (local parent is not an ancestor of the child).

**Why It's Surprising**: Git handles remote vs local refs transparently - creating branches from either just works. Graphite's stack tracking requires the local parent branch to be an ancestor of the new branch, which fails silently if local has diverged from remote.

**Solution**: The `GraphiteBranchManager.create_branch()` method handles parent branch state via `_ensure_local_matches_remote()`:

1. If local branch doesn't exist, create it from remote
2. If local exists and matches remote, proceed normally
3. If local has diverged from remote, force-update the local branch to match remote

The force-update is safe because by the time `_ensure_local_matches_remote()` runs, the new child branch has already been checked out, so we're not on the local parent branch being updated.

**When This Happens**:

- User has local commits on parent branch not yet pushed
- Parent branch was rebased/amended remotely
- `gt sync` was not run after another user pushed to parent

**Location in Codebase**: `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/branch_manager/graphite.py` - `_ensure_local_matches_remote()` method

## Branch Restoration After Graphite Tracking

**Surprising Behavior**: Graphite's `gt track` command requires the branch to be checked out. After tracking, the original branch is not automatically restored.

**Why It's Surprising**: Most git operations don't require checkout, and callers expect `create_branch()` to not change the current branch.

**Solution**: `GraphiteBranchManager.create_branch()` saves and restores the current branch:

1. Save current branch before operations
2. Create and checkout new branch
3. Track with Graphite
4. Checkout original branch

This ensures callers can create multiple branches without unexpected working directory changes.

**Location in Codebase**: `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/branch_manager/graphite.py`

## graphite_restack_required Error

The `graphite_restack_required` error type is set in `SubmitError.error_type` when `gt submit` fails because the remote has diverged. It is detected by keyword matching on the RuntimeError message from `gt submit`. See `_graphite_first_flow()` in `src/erk/cli/commands/pr/submit_pipeline.py`.

**Meaning:** "You need to restack before this operation can proceed." (Restack hasn't been attempted yet.)

## Graphite SHA Tracking Divergence

**Problem**: Graphite's `.graphite_cache_persist` file stores a `branchRevision` SHA for each tracked branch. After rebase or restack operations, the actual git SHA changes but Graphite's tracked SHA becomes stale.

**Why It's Surprising**: Users expect Graphite to stay synchronized with git operations, but Graphite's cache can fall behind, causing submission failures or incorrect stack relationships.

### Detection Pattern

Use `is_branch_diverged_from_tracking()` on the Graphite gateway ABC to compare git commit SHA against Graphite's tracked SHA:

```python
if ctx.graphite.is_branch_diverged_from_tracking(ctx.git, repo_root, branch_name):
    # Branch SHA differs from Graphite's cached revision
    ...
```

When implementing divergence checks, both `commit_sha` and `graphite_tracked_sha` must be non-None for a valid comparison. Returning `False` when either is `None` avoids false negatives on new branches that haven't been tracked yet.

### Auto-Fix Pattern

Use `retrack_branch()` to resynchronize:

```python
if ctx.graphite.is_branch_diverged_from_tracking(ctx.git, repo_root, branch_name):
    # Re-track to update Graphite's SHA
    ctx.graphite_branch_ops.retrack_branch(repo_root, branch_name)
```

### When Divergence Occurs

- After `git rebase` outside of Graphite
- After amending commits
- After `gt restack` if cache update fails
- After force-push from another machine

**Location in Codebase**: See `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/graphite/` for tracking operations.

### Retracking Required After Commit Amend or Restack (PR #6052)

**Surprising Behavior**: After `gt restack` rebases a branch, it creates new commit SHAs, but Graphite's internal cache (`.graphite_cache_persist`) still points to old SHAs. This leaves branches "diverged" from Graphite's perspective.

**Consequences**:

- `gt track` on child branches fails with "parent branch is diverged" errors
- Graphite commands refuse to operate on "diverged" branches
- Manual `gt track` (with no args) fixes it, but must be done proactively

**Why It's Surprising**: You'd expect `gt restack` to update its own tracking automatically. Instead, the cache update can fail silently, leaving the branch in a diverged state that breaks child branch operations.

**Detection Pattern**:

```python
# Check if branch SHA differs from Graphite's cached revision
is_diverged = ctx.graphite.is_branch_diverged_from_tracking(
    ctx.git, repo_root, branch_name
)
```

**Auto-Fix Pattern**:

```python
# Retrack to update Graphite's internal cache
if ctx.graphite.is_branch_diverged_from_tracking(ctx.git, repo_root, branch_name):
    ctx.graphite_branch_ops.retrack_branch(repo_root, branch_name)
```

**Where Auto-Fixes Are Implemented**:

1. **checkout_cmd.py**, **rewrite_cmd.py**, **submit_pipeline.py**: After restack operations
2. **branch_manager/graphite.py**: Before tracking child branches
   - Auto-fixes diverged parent before `gt track` to prevent creation failures

**Code References**:

- Gateway method: `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/graphite/branch_ops/real.py` (`retrack_branch()`)
- Divergence detection: `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/graphite/abc.py` (`is_branch_diverged_from_tracking()`)
- Branch creation auto-fix: `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/branch_manager/graphite.py`
- Fix commit: `8b8b06b5` (PR #6052)

## Force-Update Limitation on Checked-Out Branches

**Surprising Behavior**: `_ensure_local_matches_remote()` in `graphite.py` silently skips force-updating a branch if it's currently checked out. Instead of failing or switching branches, it returns early and relies on `retrack_branch()` to handle any tracking divergence.

<!-- Source: packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/branch_manager/graphite.py, _ensure_local_matches_remote -->

**Why It's Surprising**: Git refuses to force-update the currently checked-out branch (it would make the working tree inconsistent). Rather than switching away and back, the code takes the defensive approach: skip the update and let retracking handle divergence.

**Detection Pattern**: The method performs an LBYL check comparing the target branch against the currently checked-out branch. If they match, it returns early rather than attempting a force-update that git would reject.

**When This Happens**:

- Creating a branch from `origin/parent` when `parent` is checked out locally
- Parent branch diverged from remote but user is currently on it

**Location in Codebase**: `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/branch_manager/graphite.py` — `_ensure_local_matches_remote()` method

## `get_git_dir()` vs `get_git_common_dir()` Distinction

**Surprising Behavior**: Rebase state files (`.git/rebase-merge/`, `.git/rebase-apply/`) live in the **per-worktree** git directory, not the common (shared) directory. Using `get_git_common_dir()` to check for rebase state in a linked worktree returns the wrong path, causing `is_rebase_in_progress()` to report false negatives.

**Why It's Surprising**: Many git state files (objects, refs, config) live in the common directory shared across worktrees. Rebase state is an exception — it's per-worktree because each worktree can have its own independent rebase in progress.

**Key Methods**:

| Method                            | Git Command                      | Returns                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GitRepoOps.get_git_dir()`        | `git rev-parse --git-dir`        | Per-worktree directory (e.g., `.git/worktrees/slot-05`) |
| `GitRepoOps.get_git_common_dir()` | `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` | Shared directory (e.g., `.git`)                         |

**Rule**: Use `get_git_dir()` for per-worktree state (rebase, HEAD, index). Use `get_git_common_dir()` for shared state (objects, refs, config).

**Location in Codebase**: `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/git/repo_ops/abc.py` — both methods defined on `GitRepoOps` ABC. Added in PR #8838.

## Non-Stacked PR Graphite Registration

**Surprising Behavior**: `erk slot teleport` previously returned early for non-stacked PRs (where base = trunk), skipping Graphite registration entirely. This meant the branch wasn't tracked by Graphite after teleport, causing subsequent stack-aware operations to fail.

**Why It's Surprising**: Non-stacked PRs don't need parent branch fetching (since trunk is always local), leading to an incorrect optimization that skipped all Graphite setup — not just the fetch.

<!-- Source: packages/erk-slots/src/erk_slots/teleport_cmd.py, _register_with_graphite -->

**Solution**: `_register_with_graphite()` in `packages/erk-slots/src/erk_slots/teleport_cmd.py` now handles both paths:

1. **Stacked PRs** (base ≠ trunk): Fetch base branch if not local, create tracking branch, then register with Graphite
2. **Non-stacked PRs** (base = trunk): Skip base fetch (trunk is always present), but still register/retrack with Graphite

The registration step checks `get_parent_branch()`: if `None`, calls `track_branch()` for initial registration; if already tracked, calls `retrack_branch()` to update the SHA.

**Location in Codebase**: `packages/erk-slots/src/erk_slots/teleport_cmd.py` — `_register_with_graphite()`

## Plumbing Commit Retrack Requirement

**Surprising Behavior**: After `commit_files_to_branch()` plumbing operations (used in dispatch and incremental dispatch), the branch ref advances to a new commit SHA, but Graphite's tracked SHA remains stale. This is distinct from the post-rebase retrack already documented above — rebase changes existing commit SHAs, while plumbing commits add new commits.

**Why It's Surprising**: The plumbing commit creates a valid git commit on the branch, but Graphite doesn't observe raw ref updates — it only tracks changes made through its own commands.

<!-- Source: src/erk/cli/commands/exec/scripts/incremental_dispatch.py -->

**Solution**: Always call `retrack_branch()` after `commit_files_to_branch()` plumbing operations:

```python
branch_manager = require_branch_manager(ctx)
branch_manager.retrack_branch(repo_root, branch_name)
```

**Where Applied**: `src/erk/cli/commands/exec/scripts/incremental_dispatch.py`
