# erk_shared Package

The `erk_shared` package (`packages/erk-shared/`) contains reusable code that can be shared between the main `erk` package and future packages.

## When to Use erk_shared

| Situation                           | Location               |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Code only used by erk CLI           | `src/erk/`             |
| Reusable utilities and abstractions | `packages/erk-shared/` |

## Import Rules

1. **erk can import from erk_shared** ✅
2. **erk_shared should not import from erk** ❌

## Moving Code to erk_shared

When code needs to be shared:

1. Move the code to appropriate `erk_shared` submodule
2. Update ALL imports to use `erk_shared` directly
3. Do NOT create re-export files (see [No Re-exports Policy](../conventions.md#no-re-exports-for-internal-code))
