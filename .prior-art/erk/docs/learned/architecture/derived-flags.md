# Derived Flags Pattern

When a boolean flag should be auto-enabled based on context (e.g., plan implementation always needs force-push), derive an **effective flag** that combines user intent with auto-detection.

## Pattern

```python
effective_flag = user_flag or auto_detected_condition
```

## Canonical Example: Auto-Force Push

<!-- Source: src/erk/cli/commands/pr/submit_pipeline.py, _run_phase1_graphite_submit -->

See `_run_phase1_graphite_submit()` in `src/erk/cli/commands/pr/submit_pipeline.py`. The plan detection condition combines `state.plan_id is not None` (normal case) with `state.branch_name.startswith("plnd/")` (fallback when impl-context was deleted before push). The effective force flag is then `state.force or is_plan_impl`.

**Why:** Plan implementation branches always diverge from remote because the draft PR scaffolding commits differ from the worker's implementation commits. Requiring `--force` every time would be a UX burden with no safety benefit.

## User Transparency

Always echo when auto-behavior activates:

```python
if is_plan_impl and not state.force:
    user_output(click.style(
        "  Auto-force enabled (plan implementation branch)",
        dim=True,
    ))
```

The dim styling signals informational output (not an error or warning).

## When to Use

- The flag has a clear auto-detection condition (not heuristic)
- The auto-detected case is always safe (no risk of data loss)
- The user would always pass the flag in that context anyway

## When NOT to Use

- The auto-detection is heuristic or could be wrong
- The flag controls a destructive operation where false positives matter
- The user should make an explicit choice
