# Architecture Tripwires

Rules triggered by matching actions in code.

**FakePromptExecutor tracks all calls via properties** → Read [Prompt Executor Gateway](prompt-executor-gateway.md) first. use .prompt_calls, .interactive_calls, .passthrough_calls for assertions

**accessing ctx.git or ctx.repo without checking for NoRepoSentinel** → Read [No-Repo Infrastructure](no-repo-infrastructure.md) first. Commands decorated with @no_repo_required may have sentinel gateways. Check isinstance(ctx.repo, NoRepoSentinel) before repo operations.

**accessing ctx.obj directly without a require\_\*() helper** → Read [Click Context Dependency Injection Pattern](click-context-di-pattern.md) first. Use typed require\_\*() helpers (require_issues, require_git, require_cwd, etc.) instead of direct ctx.obj access. Helpers provide type narrowing and clear error messages.

**accessing plan_ref.pr_id as int without checking** → Read [PlanRef Architecture](plan-ref-architecture.md) first. pr_id is a string. Use LBYL: `plan_ref.pr_id.isdigit()` before `int(plan_ref.pr_id)`. Supports future non-numeric providers like 'PROJ-123'.

**accessing properties on a discriminated union result without isinstance() check** → Read [Discriminated Union Error Handling](discriminated-union-error-handling.md) first. Always check isinstance(result, ErrorType) before accessing success-variant properties. Without type narrowing, you may access .message on a success type or .data on an error type.

**adding HTML, badges, or GitHub-specific markup to commit messages** → Read [PR Body Formatting Pattern](pr-body-formatting.md) first. Use the two-target pattern: plain text pr_body for commits, enhanced pr_body_for_github for the PR. Never put GitHub-specific HTML into git commit messages.

**adding LBYL guards that only check a subset of required fields** → Read [Erk Architecture Patterns](erk-architecture.md) first. Functions with 'skip silently' contracts must validate ALL preconditions with LBYL guards. Checking one field (e.g., schema_version) is insufficient — use set operations to verify all required fields.

**adding LLM-dependent logic inside a Click @command function in exec/scripts/** → Read [Inference Hoisting Pattern](inference-hoisting.md) first. Inference hoisting violation: exec scripts run as subprocesses; they cannot nest LLM calls within a Claude Code session. Move reasoning to the calling skill.

**adding a Claude subprocess call with --print mode** → Read [Subprocess Wrappers](subprocess-wrappers.md) first. Always include --no-session-persistence flag and use env=build_claude_subprocess_env() parameter. Both are required to prevent session persistence and CLAUDECODE context leakage. See the 'Claude Subprocess Environment' section.

**adding a field to GlobalConfig without updating the test factory** → Read [GlobalConfig Field Addition Checklist](globalconfig-field-addition.md) first. Update GlobalConfig.test() factory method with the new parameter. Tests using GlobalConfig.test() will silently use Python's default value, which may not match production behavior.

**adding a field to PullRequestInfo in types.py** → Read [GitHub Interface Patterns](github-interface-patterns.md) first. Must update all three parsers in real.py: \_parse_pr_from_timeline_event(), list_prs(), and \_parse_plan_prs_with_details(). See PullRequestInfo Field Addition Protocol in this doc.

**adding a field to a GraphQL query that uses ISSUE_PR_LINKAGE_FRAGMENT** → Read [GitHub Interface Patterns](github-interface-patterns.md) first. Check GET_PLAN_PRS_WITH_DETAILS_QUERY for divergence. Both queries fetch PR fields but are defined separately in graphql_queries.py. A field in one but not the other causes None values in some code paths.

**adding a get_X() method to a gateway ABC without a corresponding X_exists() convenience method** → Read [LBYL Gateway Pattern](lbyl-gateway-pattern.md) first. Gateway ABCs pair fetch methods with lightweight existence checks. Add X_exists() alongside get_X() for LBYL compliance at CLI boundaries.

**adding a new CLI entry point that calls plan or objective services** → Read [HTTP-Accelerated Plan Refresh](http-accelerated-plan-refresh.md) first. Must validate ctx.http_client is not None before calling service methods. Follow the pattern in existing entry points (pr list, pr duplicate-check, objective list, exec dash-data).

**adding a new call site for run_commit_message_generation without time parameter** → Read [Progress Feedback Two-Layer Threading](progress-feedback-threading.md) first. The time parameter is required for test isolation. Pass time=ctx.time from the ErkContext.

**adding a new dispatch handler that does not return (branch_name, run_id)** → Read [Unified Dispatch Pattern](unified-dispatch-pattern.md) first. All PR-targeting dispatch handlers must return (branch_name, run_id) for post-dispatch metadata enrichment. learn and consolidate-learn-plans are exceptions (no branch/run_id needed for metadata). See unified-dispatch-pattern.md.

**adding a new field to ErkContext dataclass** → Read [Erk Architecture Patterns](erk-architecture.md) first. Update ALL factory functions. Grep: `grep -r 'ErkContext(' packages/erk-shared/src/ src/erk/core/context.py` to find all construction sites. Missing a factory causes runtime errors or silent None values.

**adding a new field to agent-produced JSON without updating normalization** → Read [Agent Schema Enforcement](agent-schema-enforcement.md) first. Add the field to CANONICAL_FIELDS and any aliases to FIELD_ALIASES in the normalization script. Without this, the field may be stripped during normalization.

**adding a new method to HttpClient ABC without implementing in all providers** → Read [HTTP-Accelerated Plan Refresh](http-accelerated-plan-refresh.md) first. HttpClient follows the gateway pattern. New methods must be added to abc.py, real.py, and fake.py at minimum.

**adding a new method to a 3-file gateway ABC** → Read [Gateway ABC Implementation Checklist](gateway-abc-implementation.md) first. Must implement in 3 places: abc.py, real.py, fake.py.

**adding a new method to a dry-run-enabled gateway ABC (Git, LocalGitHub, Graphite)** → Read [Gateway ABC Implementation Checklist](gateway-abc-implementation.md) first. Must implement in 4 places: abc.py, real.py, fake.py, dry_run.py.

**adding a new parameter to a gateway ABC method** → Read [Gateway ABC Implementation Checklist](gateway-abc-implementation.md) first. All implementations must be updated (3 or 4 depending on pattern). Fake may accept but not track new parameters when assertion is not needed for tests.

**adding a new setup path to a command with existing cleanup** → Read [Convergence Points Architecture](convergence-points.md) first. Ensure the new path calls the same convergence function. Multiple setup paths must converge at a single cleanup point to prevent resource leaks.

**adding a parameter to an erk exec script without updating the calling slash command** → Read [Parameter Threading Pattern](parameter-threading-pattern.md) first. 3-layer parameter threading: When adding a parameter, update all three layers: skill SKILL.md argument-hint, slash command .md, and erk exec script. Verify all invocations thread the parameter through.

**adding a subgateway property to a gateway ABC** → Read [Flatten Subgateway Pattern](flatten-subgateway-pattern.md) first. Must implement property in 4 places: ABC with TYPE_CHECKING import guard, Real with concrete instance, Fake with linked state, DryRun wrapping inner subgateway.

**adding a validation gate without actionable feedback in the error message** → Read [Agent Back Pressure via Gates](agent-backpressure-gates.md) first. Gates must include the expected pattern, the actual value, and examples so the agent can self-correct. See InvalidObjectiveSlug.message for the pattern.

**adding file I/O, network calls, or subprocess invocations to a class **init\***\* → Read [Erk Architecture Patterns](erk-architecture.md) first. Load `dignified-python` skill first. Class **init\*\* should be lightweight (just data assignment). Heavy operations belong in static factory methods like `from_config_path()` or `load()`. This enables direct instantiation in tests without I/O setup.

**adding guidance to the agent without a programmatic gate to enforce it** → Read [Agent Back Pressure via Gates](agent-backpressure-gates.md) first. Guidance without enforcement is optional compliance. The gate is the hard boundary. The agent should have guidance to help it succeed on the first try, but the gate is what enforces correctness.

**adding new file format support without read-then-fallback** → Read [Erk Architecture Patterns](erk-architecture.md) first. When adding new file formats, implement read-then-fallback: try new format first, fall back to old format transparently. See read_plan_ref() for the canonical pattern.

**adding new git operations that require a branch checkout** → Read [Git Plumbing Patterns](git-plumbing-patterns.md) first. When adding new git operations, prefer plumbing (update-ref, commit-tree) over checkout-based workflows. See git-plumbing-patterns.md.

**adding optional fields to pipeline state without defaults** → Read [State Threading Pattern](state-threading-pattern.md) first. New pipeline state fields must have defaults (usually None) to avoid breaking make_initial_state() factories. See optional-field-propagation.md for the pattern.

**adding re-exports to gateway implementation modules** → Read [Re-Export Pattern](re-export-pattern.md) first. Only re-export types that genuinely improve public API. Add # noqa: F401 - re-exported for <reason> comment.

**adding regex validation inline instead of module-level compilation** → Read [Validation Patterns](validation-patterns.md) first. Compile regex patterns at module level as named constants. See LAST_AUDITED_PATTERN in operations.py:30 for the canonical example.

**adding subprocess.run or run_subprocess_with_context calls to a gateway real.py file** [pattern: `subprocess\.run\(|run_subprocess_with_context\(`] → Read [Gateway ABC Implementation Checklist](gateway-abc-implementation.md) first. Must add integration tests in tests/integration/test*real*\*.py. Real gateway methods with subprocess calls need tests that verify the actual subprocess behavior.

**amending a commit when Graphite is enabled** → Read [Git and Graphite Edge Cases Catalog](git-graphite-quirks.md) first. After amending commits or running gt restack, Graphite's cache may not update, leaving branches diverged. Call retrack_branch() to fix tracking. The auto-fix is already implemented in checkout_cmd, rewrite_cmd, submit_pipeline, and branch_manager.

**archiving value to 'last\_' variant BEFORE clearing** → Read [Archive-on-Clear Metadata Pattern](metadata-archival-pattern.md) first. Order matters — clear-then-archive loses the value silently

**assuming GitHub API failures are transient without repository-specific testing** → Read [GitHub API Diagnostics](github-api-diagnostics.md) first. Test with a control repository first. Some GitHub bugs affect specific repos but not others. Follow the 3-step diagnostic methodology.

**assuming cursor position will persist across DataTable.clear() calls** → Read [Selection Preservation by Value](selection-preservation-by-value.md) first. Save cursor position by row key before clear(), restore after repopulating. See textual/quirks.md for pattern.

**assuming plan branch is always in root worktree** → Read [Worktree Detection in Dispatch](worktree-dispatch-detection.md) first. Branch may already be checked out in a slot worktree. Use find_worktree_for_branch() to detect.

**auto-enabling a flag without informing the user** → Read [Derived Flags Pattern](derived-flags.md) first. When deriving a flag from auto-detection, always print a dim-styled informational message explaining why the behavior was activated. Users should never be surprised by automatic actions.

**bypassing PrListService for direct GitHub API plan queries** → Read [HTTP-Accelerated Plan Refresh](http-accelerated-plan-refresh.md) first. PrListService handles HTTP API calls. Direct API calls bypass caching and error handling.

**calling .read_text() or .write_text() without encoding parameter** → Read [Erk Architecture Patterns](erk-architecture.md) first. Always pass encoding='utf-8' to .read_text() and .write_text(). Python's default encoding varies by platform.

**calling GraphiteBranchManager.create_branch() without explicit checkout** → Read [Erk Architecture Patterns](erk-architecture.md) first. GraphiteBranchManager.create_branch() restores the original branch after tracking. Always call branch_manager.checkout_branch() afterward if you need to be on the new branch.

**calling PromptExecutor, generate_branch_slug, or BranchSlugGenerator from an exec script** [pattern: `PromptExecutor|generate_branch_slug|BranchSlugGenerator`] → Read [Inference Hoisting Pattern](inference-hoisting.md) first. Exec scripts must be deterministic. LLM calls belong in the skill layer (.claude/commands/\*.md). Hoist: generate the value in the skill, pass it via --flag to the exec script. Read inference-hoisting.md.

**calling allocate_slot_for_branch without sync_pool_assignments running first** → Read [Slot Pool State Sync](slot-pool-state-sync.md) first. Pool sync must run BEFORE find_branch_assignment call. Without it, stale pool.json entries cause silent misassignment — a slot may appear free when it's actually occupied by a different branch.

**calling assemble_pr_body without metadata_prefix for planned-PR plans** → Read [PR Body Assembly](pr-body-assembly.md) first. Planned PR plans require metadata_prefix from find_metadata_block(). Without it, plan-header metadata is lost on every PR rewrite.

**calling checkout_branch() in a multi-worktree repository** → Read [Multi-Worktree State Handling](multi-worktree-state.md) first. Verify the target branch is not already checked out in another worktree using `git.worktree.find_worktree_for_branch()`. Git enforces a single-checkout constraint - attempting to checkout a branch held elsewhere causes silent state corruption or unexpected failures.

**calling create_branch() and assuming you're on the new branch** → Read [BranchManager Abstraction](branch-manager-abstraction.md) first. GraphiteBranchManager.create_branch() restores the original branch after Graphite tracking. Always call branch_manager.checkout_branch() afterward if you need to be on the new branch.

**calling ctx.git mutation methods (create_branch, delete_branch, checkout_branch, checkout_detached, create_tracking_branch)** → Read [Erk Architecture Patterns](erk-architecture.md) first. Use ctx.branch_manager instead. Branch mutation methods are in GitBranchOps sub-gateway, accessible only through BranchManager. Query methods (get_current_branch, list_local_branches, etc.) remain on ctx.git.

**calling ctx.git.branch mutation methods directly (create_branch, delete_branch, checkout_branch, checkout_detached, create_tracking_branch)** → Read [BranchManager Abstraction](branch-manager-abstraction.md) first. Use ctx.branch_manager instead for all user-facing branches. Only use ctx.git.branch directly for ephemeral/placeholder branches that should never be Graphite-tracked. See branch-manager-decision-tree.md.

**calling ctx.graphite mutation methods (track_branch, delete_branch, submit_branch)** → Read [Erk Architecture Patterns](erk-architecture.md) first. Use ctx.branch_manager instead. Branch mutation methods are in GraphiteBranchOps sub-gateway, accessible only through BranchManager. Query methods (is_branch_tracked, get_parent_branch, etc.) remain on ctx.graphite.

**calling ctx.graphite_branch_ops mutation methods directly (track_branch, delete_branch, submit_branch)** → Read [BranchManager Abstraction](branch-manager-abstraction.md) first. Use ctx.branch_manager instead. GraphiteBranchOps is a sub-gateway that BranchManager delegates to internally. Direct calls bypass the dual-mode abstraction.

**calling delete_branch() without passing the force parameter through** → Read [BranchManager Abstraction](branch-manager-abstraction.md) first. The force flag controls -D (force) vs -d (safe) git delete. Dropping it silently changes behavior. Always flow force=force through all layers.

**calling execute_gh_command() instead of execute_gh_command_with_retry() for network-sensitive operations** → Read [GitHub API Retry Mechanism](github-api-retry-mechanism.md) first. Use `execute_gh_command_with_retry()` for operations that may fail due to transient network errors. Pass `time_impl` for testability.

**calling get_X() and handling IssueNotFound sentinel inline** → Read [LBYL Gateway Pattern](lbyl-gateway-pattern.md) first. Check with X_exists() first for cleaner error messages and LBYL compliance.

**calling gh CLI for GitHub API operations in remote mode** → Read [RemoteGitHub Gateway](remote-github-gateway.md) first. use RemoteGitHub gateway instead. Remote mode has no local git/gh CLI.

**calling gh api directly in an exec script for plan metadata updates** → Read [ManagedPrBackend Migration Pattern](plan-backend-migration.md) first. Use `require_pr_backend(ctx)` + backend methods instead. Direct gh calls bypass the abstraction and testability layers.

**calling graphite.track_branch() with a remote ref like origin/main** → Read [Git and Graphite Edge Cases Catalog](git-graphite-quirks.md) first. Graphite's `gt track` only accepts local branch names, not remote refs. Use BranchManager.create_branch() which normalizes refs automatically, or strip `origin/` prefix before calling track_branch().

**calling gt commands without --no-interactive flag** [pattern: `\bgt\s+(sync|submit|restack|create|modify)`] → Read [Git and Graphite Edge Cases Catalog](git-graphite-quirks.md) first. Always use `--no-interactive` with gt commands (gt sync, gt submit, gt restack, etc.). Without this flag, gt may prompt for user input and hang indefinitely. Note: `--force` does NOT prevent prompts - you must use `--no-interactive` separately.

**calling os.chdir() in erk code** [pattern: `os\.chdir\(`] → Read [Erk Architecture Patterns](erk-architecture.md) first. After os.chdir(), regenerate context using regenerate_context(ctx). Stale ctx.cwd causes FileNotFoundError.

**calling resolve_impl_dir() without passing branch_name** → Read [Impl-Folder Discovery Algorithm](impl-folder-discovery.md) first. Branch-scoped lookup is skipped when branch_name is None. Always pass the current branch to get deterministic resolution. Discovery fallback scans for ANY subdirectory with plan.md, which may find the wrong plan.

**calling save_plan_ref with positional arguments** → Read [PlanRef Architecture](plan-ref-architecture.md) first. All parameters after `impl_dir` are keyword-only. Positional calls will fail at runtime.

**calling time.sleep() or time.monotonic() directly in progress feedback code** → Read [Progress Feedback Two-Layer Threading](progress-feedback-threading.md) first. Use ctx.time.sleep() and ctx.time.monotonic() for testability. All production call sites pass time=ctx.time.

**calling update_local_ref on a branch without checking if it is checked out** → Read [sync_branch_to_sha Pattern](sync-branch-to-sha-pattern.md) first. Use sync_branch_to_sha instead. It detects checkout state and handles dirty worktrees. Direct update_local_ref on a checked-out branch desynchronizes the index. See sync-branch-to-sha-pattern.md.

**changing a gateway method signature** → Read [Gateway Signature Migration](gateway-signature-migration.md) first. Search for ALL callers with grep before changing. PR #6329 migrated 8 call sites across 7 files. Missing a call site causes runtime errors.

**changing config section names ([interactive-claude] or [interactive-agent])** → Read [Interactive Agent Configuration](interactive-agent-config.md) first. Maintain fallback from [interactive-agent] to [interactive-claude] for backward compatibility.

**changing erk_shared function signatures** → Read [Gateway Signature Migration](gateway-signature-migration.md) first. Grep all callers across full repo before committing. Missed call sites cause CI failures.

**changing gateway return type to discriminated union** → Read [Gateway ABC Implementation Checklist](gateway-abc-implementation.md) first. Verify all implementations import the new types. For 4-file gateways: abc.py, real.py, fake.py, dry_run.py. For 3-file gateways: abc.py, real.py, fake.py.

**changing permission_mode_to_claude() (or future permission_mode_to_codex()) implementations** → Read [PermissionMode Abstraction](permission-modes.md) first. Verify both Claude and Codex backend implementations maintain identical enum-to-mode mappings.

**checking if get_pr_for_branch() returned a PR** [pattern: `get_pr_for_branch\(`] → Read [Not-Found Sentinel Pattern](not-found-sentinel.md) first. Use `isinstance(pr, PRNotFound)` not `pr is not None`. PRNotFound is a sentinel object, not None.

**checking isinstance after RetriesExhausted without type narrowing** → Read [GitHub API Retry Mechanism](github-api-retry-mechanism.md) first. After checking `isinstance(result, RetriesExhausted)`, the else branch is type-narrowed to the success type. Use `assert isinstance(result, T)` if needed for clarity.

**checking isinstance(ctx.graphite, GraphiteDisabled) inline in command code** [pattern: `isinstance\(.*GraphiteDisabled\)`] → Read [Erk Architecture Patterns](erk-architecture.md) first. Use BranchManager abstraction instead. Add a method to BranchManager ABC that handles both Graphite and Git paths. This centralizes the branching logic and enables testing with FakeBranchManager.

**checking out a branch in plan_save to commit files** → Read [Git Plumbing Patterns](git-plumbing-patterns.md) first. Plan save uses git plumbing (commit_files_to_branch) to commit without checkout. Do NOT add checkout_branch calls. See git-plumbing-patterns.md.

**choosing between exceptions and discriminated unions for operation failures** → Read [Discriminated Union Error Handling](discriminated-union-error-handling.md) first. If callers branch on the error and continue the operation, use discriminated unions. If all callers just terminate and surface the message, use exceptions. Read the 'When to Use' section.

**choosing between post_event and update_metadata** → Read [ManagedPrBackend Migration Pattern](plan-backend-migration.md) first. post_event = metadata update + optional comment. update_metadata = metadata only. Use post_event when the operation should be visible to users in the issue timeline.

**committing files to a branch that may be checked out in a worktree** → Read [Checked-Out Branch Handling Pattern](checked-out-branch-handling.md) first. git branch -f fails on checked-out branches. Use is_branch_checked_out() to detect, then update_local_ref() instead of create_branch(). Sync working tree with 'git checkout HEAD --'. See checked-out-branch-handling.md.

**comparing git SHA to Graphite's tracked SHA for divergence detection** → Read [Git and Graphite Edge Cases Catalog](git-graphite-quirks.md) first. Ensure both `commit_sha` and `graphite_tracked_sha` are non-None before comparison. Returning False when either is None avoids false negatives on new branches.

**comparing worktree path to repo_root to detect root worktree** → Read [Erk Architecture Patterns](erk-architecture.md) first. Use WorktreeInfo.is_root instead of path comparison. Path comparison fails when running from within a non-root worktree because ctx.cwd resolves differently.

**constructing PlannedPRBackend with positional arguments or wrong parameter order** → Read [Gateway vs Backend ABC Pattern](gateway-vs-backend.md) first. PlannedPRBackend constructor takes keyword-only gateway dependencies. Check the current **init** signature — it evolves as gateways are added. Use keyword arguments explicitly.

**constructing gist raw URLs with hardcoded filenames** → Read [GitHub Gist URL Patterns](github-gist-api.md) first. Use /raw/ without filename - GitHub redirects to first file.

**creating .erk/impl-context/ without using create_impl_context()** → Read [Impl-Context API](impl-context-api.md) first. Use the three-function API in impl_context.py. Manual folder creation skips validation and ref.json generation.

**creating Protocol with bare attributes for frozen dataclasses** → Read [Protocol vs ABC Interface Design Guide](protocol-vs-abc.md) first. Use @property decorators in Protocol for frozen dataclass compatibility. Bare attributes cause type errors.

**creating a gateway named ShellRunner, CommandRunner, SubprocessGateway, or similar mechanism-named gateway** → Read [Gateway ABC Implementation Checklist](gateway-abc-implementation.md) first. Gateway names must reflect the TOOL being wrapped, not the execution mechanism. Use LocalGitHub for gh calls, Git for git calls, CmuxGateway for cmux calls, PromptExecutor for claude calls. A mechanism-named gateway is just moving the mock up one layer without gaining abstraction.

**creating a new ABC without deciding gateway vs backend pattern** → Read [Gateway vs Backend ABC Pattern](gateway-vs-backend.md) first. Read gateway-vs-backend.md first. Gateways wrap external tools (4-place: abc, real, fake, dry_run). Backends abstract business logic (3-place: abc, real, fake). Wrong choice creates unnecessary boilerplate or missing test support. Note: the plan backend ABC is ManagedPrBackend (not PlanBackend — that name was retired).

**creating a new complex command with multiple validation steps** → Read [Linear Pipeline Architecture](linear-pipelines.md) first. Consider two-pipeline pattern: validation pipeline (check preconditions) + execution pipeline (perform operations). Use discriminated unions (State | Error) for pipeline steps. Reference land_pipeline.py as exemplar.

**creating a new gateway ABC** → Read [Gateway ABC Implementation Checklist](gateway-abc-implementation.md) first. Default is 3-file pattern (abc.py, real.py, fake.py). Only add dry_run.py if the gateway participates in a user-facing --dry-run feature. Most gateways do not.

**creating a new gateway directory under packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/** → Read [Gateway ABC Implementation Checklist](gateway-abc-implementation.md) first. Must also wire into ErkContext: add field to context.py dataclass, add parameter to for_test(), and wire Real\* in production factory (src/erk/core/context.py). See 'New Gateway: ErkContext Wiring' section.

**creating branches in erk code** → Read [Branch Manager Decision Tree](branch-manager-decision-tree.md) first. Use the decision tree to determine whether to use ctx.branch_manager (with Graphite tracking) or ctx.git.branch (low-level git). Placeholder/ephemeral branches bypass branch_manager.

**creating custom FakeGitHubIssues without passing to test context builder** → Read [Test Context Composition](test-context-composition.md) first. Always pass issues=issues to build_workspace_test_context when using custom FakeGitHubIssues. Without it, pr_backend operates on a different instance and metadata writes are invisible.

**creating fake subgateway without shared state** → Read [Flatten Subgateway Pattern](flatten-subgateway-pattern.md) first. Fake subgateways must share state containers with parent via constructor parameters and call link_mutation_tracking(). Without this, mutations through subgateway won't be visible to parent queries.

**deleting a gateway after consolidating into another** → Read [Gateway Removal Pattern](gateway-removal-pattern.md) first. Follow complete removal checklist: verify no references, delete all 5 layers, clean up compositions, update docs, run full test suite.

**designing a new hook or reminder system** → Read [Context Injection Architecture](context-injection-tiers.md) first. Consider the three-tier context architecture and consolidation patterns. Read docs/learned/architecture/context-injection-tiers.md first.

**designing error handling for a new gateway method** → Read [Gateway ABC Implementation Checklist](gateway-abc-implementation.md) first. Ask: does the caller continue after the failure? If yes, use discriminated union. If all callers terminate, use exceptions. See 'Non-Ideal State Decision Checklist' section.

**detecting current worktree using path comparisons on cwd** → Read [Erk Architecture Patterns](erk-architecture.md) first. Use git.get_repository_root(cwd) to get the worktree root, then match exactly against known paths. Path comparisons with .exists()/.resolve()/is_relative_to() are fragile.

**detecting mode after Phase 0 has already executed** → Read [Phase 0 Detection Pattern](phase-zero-detection-pattern.md) first. Late detection wastes work and creates scattered conditionals across all phases

**dispatching a workflow directly from the launch command body without a handler** → Read [Unified Dispatch Pattern](unified-dispatch-pattern.md) first. Add a dedicated _dispatch_<workflow> handler function. The handler pattern separates PR lookup, validation, input building, and dispatch. See unified-dispatch-pattern.md.

**duplicating environment setup in remote commands** → Read [Composable Remote Commands Pattern](composable-remote-commands.md) first. build_codespace_ssh_command() bootstraps the environment - don't duplicate setup

**execute_interactive() never returns in production** → Read [Prompt Executor Gateway](prompt-executor-gateway.md) first. it replaces the process via os.execvp

**execute_prompt() supports both single-shot and streaming modes** → Read [Prompt Executor Gateway](prompt-executor-gateway.md) first. choose based on whether you need real-time updates

**executing remote commands without calling start_codespace()** → Read [Composable Remote Commands Pattern](composable-remote-commands.md) first. Always start_codespace() before executing remote commands

**expecting status to auto-update after manual PR edits** → Read [Roadmap Mutation Semantics](roadmap-mutation-semantics.md) first. Only the update-objective-node command writes computed status. Manual GitHub edits or direct body mutations leave status at its current value — you must explicitly set status to '-' to enable inference on next parse.

**force-updating a branch that might be currently checked out** → Read [Git and Graphite Edge Cases Catalog](git-graphite-quirks.md) first. Git refuses to force-update the checked-out branch. Use LBYL check: compare target branch with current branch before force-update. See \_ensure_local_matches_remote() in graphite.py.

**hand-constructing frozen dataclass instances with selective field copying** → Read [Optional Field Propagation](optional-field-propagation.md) first. Always use dataclasses.replace() to preserve all fields. Hand-construction with partial field copying silently drops optional fields (learn_status, learn_plan_issue, objective_issue, etc.).

**implementing CLI flags that affect post-mutation behavior** → Read [Erk Architecture Patterns](erk-architecture.md) first. Validate flag preconditions BEFORE any mutations. Example: `--up` in `erk land` checks for child branches before merging PR. This prevents partial state (PR merged, worktree deleted, but no valid navigation target).

**implementing a cleanup operation that modifies metadata based on external API success** → Read [Fail-Open Pattern](fail-open-patterns.md) first. Use fail-open pattern. If critical step fails, do NOT execute dependent steps that modify persistent state.

**implementing a new `erk pr` command** → Read [PR Body Assembly](pr-body-assembly.md) first. Compare feature parity with `submit_pipeline.py`. Check: learn plan labels, footer construction, and plan details section. Use shared utilities from `shared.py` (`assemble_pr_body`).

**implementing idempotent operations that fail on missing resources** → Read [LBYL Gateway Pattern](lbyl-gateway-pattern.md) first. Use LBYL existence check to return early, making the operation truly idempotent.

**implementing mtime-based cache invalidation** → Read [Graphite Cache Invalidation](graphite-cache-invalidation.md) first. Use triple-check guard pattern: (cache exists) AND (mtime exists) AND (mtime matches). Partial checks cause stale data bugs.

**importing from erk in erk_shared code** → Read [Circular Import Resolution Pattern](circular-import-resolution.md) first. erk_shared must not import from erk. Move ABCs to erk_shared, keep implementations in erk. See circular-import-resolution.md.

**importing time module or calling time.sleep() or datetime.now()** [pattern: `\bimport time\b|time\.sleep\(|datetime\.now\(`] → Read [Erk Architecture Patterns](erk-architecture.md) first. Use context.time.sleep() and context.time.now() for testability. Direct time.sleep() makes tests slow and datetime.now() makes tests non-deterministic.

**injecting Time dependency into gateway real.py for lock-waiting or retry logic** → Read [Erk Architecture Patterns](erk-architecture.md) first. Accept optional Time in **init** with default to RealTime(). Use injected dependency in methods. This enables testing with FakeTime without blocking. See packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/git/lock.py for pattern.

**making N sequential gh api calls in a loop when a single GraphQL query could fetch all data** → Read [Gateway ABC Implementation Checklist](gateway-abc-implementation.md) first. Each gh subprocess call costs ~200-300ms overhead. Batch into a single GraphQL query with node fragments when fetching multiple items. See http-accelerated-plan-refresh.md for the dual-path pattern.

**migrating a gateway method to return discriminated union** → Read [Discriminated Union Error Handling](discriminated-union-error-handling.md) first. Update all implementations (ABC, real, fake; add dry_run only for dry-run-participating gateways) AND all call sites AND tests. Incomplete migrations break type safety.

**migrating git method calls after subgateway extraction** → Read [Gateway Decomposition Phases](gateway-decomposition-phases.md) first. The following methods have been moved from the Git ABC to subgateways: `git.fetch_branch()` → `git.remote.fetch_branch()` (Phase 3), `git.push_to_remote()` → `git.remote.push_to_remote()` (Phase 3), `git.commit()` → `git.commit.commit()` (Phase 4), `git.stage_files()` → `git.commit.stage_files()` (Phase 4), `git.has_staged_changes()` → `git.status.has_staged_changes()` (Phase 5), `git.rebase_onto()` → `git.rebase.rebase_onto()` (Phase 6), `git.tag_exists()` → `git.tag_exists()` (Phase 7), `git.create_tag()` → `git.tag.create_tag()` (Phase 7). Calling the old API will raise `AttributeError`. Always use the subgateway property.

**mixing discriminated unions with exception-based cleanup in a single method** → Read [Mixed Exception/Union Pattern (Deprecated)](gateway-specific-patterns.md) first. This pattern was tried in PR #6347 and reverted in PR #6375. Message-only discriminated unions with no domain-meaningful variants add complexity without value. Use exceptions for all error cases, or use discriminated unions with meaningful variants throughout. Document why in the PR.

**modifying Claude CLI error reporting or PromptResult.error format** → Read [Claude CLI Error Reporting](claude-cli-error-reporting.md) first. Error messages must maintain structured format with exit code, stderr, and context. Changes affect all callers of execute_prompt() and execute_command_streaming().

**modifying InteractiveAgentConfig fields or config file format** → Read [Interactive Agent Configuration](interactive-agent-config.md) first. Update both config loading (RealErkInstallation.load_config) and usage sites. Check backward compatibility with [interactive-claude] section.

**modifying PR footer format** → Read [PR Footer Format Validation](pr-footer-validation.md) first. Update generator, parser, AND validator in sync. Add support for new format BEFORE deprecating old format. Never break parsing of existing PRs.

**modifying PermissionMode enum or permission mode mappings** → Read [PermissionMode Abstraction](permission-modes.md) first. permission_mode_to_claude() (and future permission_mode_to_codex()) must stay in sync. Update both when changing mappings.

**modifying artifact allowlist loading without updating both config files** → Read [HealthCheckRunner Gateway Pattern](health-check-runner-gateway.md) first. Allowlist loads from both .erk/config.toml and .erk/config.local.toml, merging results into a frozenset.

**modifying render_metadata_block() or parse_metadata_block_body()** → Read [Metadata Blocks Reference](metadata-blocks.md) first. The canonical implementation lives in packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/github/metadata/core.py (the former metadata_blocks.py was deleted in PR #8425). Ensure all callers import from this module.

**mutating pipeline state directly instead of using dataclasses.replace()** → Read [State Threading Pattern](state-threading-pattern.md) first. Pipeline state must be frozen. Use dataclasses.replace() to create new state at each step.

**parsing CalledProcessError messages for git operations** → Read [Git Operation Patterns](git-operation-patterns.md) first. Avoid parsing git error messages to determine failure modes. Use LBYL with git show-ref --verify to check existence before operations, or design discriminated unions that handle all returncode cases explicitly.

**passing None for http_client in service methods** → Read [HTTP-Accelerated Plan Refresh](http-accelerated-plan-refresh.md) first. http_client is a required parameter (not optional) in PrListService and ObjectiveListService. Passing None causes TypeError. Validate at CLI entry point.

**passing array or object variables to gh api graphql with -F and json.dumps()** [pattern: `json\.dumps\(.*-F`] → Read [GitHub GraphQL API Patterns](github-graphql.md) first. Arrays and objects require special gh syntax: arrays use -f key[]=value1 -f key[]=value2, objects use -f key[subkey]=value. Using -F key=[...] or -F key={...} passes them as literal strings, not typed values.

**passing dry_run boolean flags through business logic function parameters** → Read [Erk Architecture Patterns](erk-architecture.md) first. Use dependency injection with DryRunGit/DryRunLocalGitHub wrappers for multi-step workflows. Simple CLI preview flags at the command level are acceptable for single-action commands.

**passing multiple labels to a GitHub GraphQL label filter expecting OR semantics** → Read [GitHub GraphQL Label Semantics](github-graphql-label-semantics.md) first. GitHub GraphQL uses AND semantics for label filters. Passing labels=['erk-pr', 'erk-learn'] returns only items with BOTH labels, not either. Query by type-specific labels separately.

**passing secret values as command-line arguments** → Read [GitHub Admin Gateway](github-admin-gateway.md) first. Secret values must be passed via stdin (input= parameter) to avoid process list exposure. See github-admin-gateway.md.

**passing variables to gh api graphql as JSON blob** [pattern: `gh\s+api\s+graphql`] → Read [GitHub GraphQL API Patterns](github-graphql.md) first. Variables must be passed individually with -f (strings) and -F (typed). The syntax `-f variables={...}` does NOT work.

**piping JSON through bash heredoc to gh api or other commands** → Read [Heredoc Quoting and Escaping in Agent-Generated Bash](bash-python-integration.md) first. JSON with special characters ($, backticks, backslashes) gets silently corrupted by bash expansion in unquoted heredocs. Use <<'EOF' (quoted) or write to a temp file and pipe from that.

**placing @handle_non_ideal_exit before @click.command() or @click.pass_context** → Read [Discriminated Union Error Handling](discriminated-union-error-handling.md) first. @handle_non_ideal_exit must come AFTER @click.command() / @click.pass_context (outermost position in decorator stack). Inner position causes it to receive wrong arguments.

**proposing branch-based session storage as a new idea** → Read [Session Storage Architecture](session-storage-revert-rationale.md) first. Session storage IS branch-based (planned-pr-context/{plan_id} branches). An earlier attempt at a different branch-based approach was tried and reverted in PR #7757→#7765. The current branch-based approach (push_session.py) is the stable implementation.

**querying plans by combining multiple type-specific labels in a single query** → Read [GitHub GraphQL Label Semantics](github-graphql-label-semantics.md) first. Query by ONE type-specific label per query (erk-pr, erk-learn). AND semantics means querying labels=['erk-pr', 'erk-learn'] returns only items with BOTH labels, which may silently exclude items.

**re-exporting symbols from **init**.py after splitting a module** → Read [Monolith-to-Subpackage Refactoring Pattern](monolith-to-subpackage-pattern.md) first. No re-exports. Each submodule has a canonical import path. The **init**.py is an orchestrator, not a facade.

**reading agent output with TaskOutput then writing it to a file with Write** → Read [Context Efficiency Patterns](context-efficiency.md) first. This is the 'content relay' anti-pattern — it causes 2x context duplication. Instead, have agents accept an output_path parameter and write directly. See /erk:learn for the canonical implementation.

**reading from or writing to ~/.claude/ paths using Path.home() directly** [pattern: `Path\.home\(\).*\.claude`] → Read [ClaudeInstallation Gateway](claude-installation-gateway.md) first. Use ClaudeInstallation gateway instead. All ~/.claude/ filesystem operations must go through this gateway for testability and storage abstraction.

**reading plan reference without using read_plan_ref()** → Read [Ref JSON Migration](ref-json-migration.md) first. Use read_plan_ref() which handles the three-file fallback chain: plan-ref.json → ref.json → issue.json (legacy). Manual JSON parsing skips fallback and field mapping.

**registering a branch with Graphite without handling stacked vs non-stacked** → Read [Git and Graphite Edge Cases Catalog](git-graphite-quirks.md) first. Both stacked PRs (base != trunk, fetch base first) and non-stacked PRs (base = trunk, skip fetch) need Graphite registration. Don't skip registration for non-stacked PRs.

**relying solely on agent-level enforcement for critical rules** → Read [Defense-in-Depth Enforcement](defense-in-depth-enforcement.md) first. Add skill-level and PR-level enforcement layers. Only workflow/CI enforcement is truly reliable.

**removing .erk/impl-context/ during implementation without git rm** → Read [Impl-Context API](impl-context-api.md) first. Use git rm -rf for committed impl-context (Step 2d of plan-implement). The remove_impl_context() function is for filesystem-only removal.

**removing an abstract method from a gateway ABC** → Read [Gateway ABC Implementation Checklist](gateway-abc-implementation.md) first. Must remove from all implementation files simultaneously (3 or 4 depending on pattern). Partial removal causes type checker errors. Update all call sites. Verify with grep across packages.

**returning a collection (list, tuple, str) directly from a function with NonIdealState return type** → Read [Discriminated Union Error Handling](discriminated-union-error-handling.md) first. Raw built-ins can't inherit EnsurableResult. Wrap in a named frozen dataclass that inherits EnsurableResult and implements **iter** if needed. See 'The Wrapping Rule' section.

**returning pre-rendered display strings from backend APIs** → Read [State Derivation Pattern](state-derivation-pattern.md) first. Return raw state fields instead. Derive display state in frontend pure functions for testability and reusability.

**running tests immediately after rebase without checking for old symbols** → Read [Rebase Conflict Patterns](rebase-conflict-patterns.md) first. Hidden regressions can exist in non-conflicted files. Grep for old symbols that should have been renamed before running tests.

**scanning derived display output (emoji lists, formatted strings) to determine state** → Read [Direct Condition vs Derived Output](direct-condition-vs-derived-output.md) first. Check original boolean conditions directly instead. Scanning derived output couples decision logic to display formatting. See direct-condition-vs-derived-output.md.

**silently transforming agent output (sanitize/normalize) instead of rejecting invalid values** → Read [Agent Back Pressure via Gates](agent-backpressure-gates.md) first. Silent transformation masks mistakes and prevents the agent from learning. Use a validation gate that rejects invalid input with actionable feedback so the agent can self-correct.

**skipping fallback strategies when the selected item might disappear** → Read [Selection Preservation by Value](selection-preservation-by-value.md) first. Always provide fallback behavior when selected item not found in refreshed data (reset to 0, preserve index clamped, or clear selection).

**suppressing F401 (unused import) warnings** → Read [Re-Export Pattern](re-export-pattern.md) first. Use # noqa: F401 comment per-import with reason, not global ruff config. Indicates intentional re-export vs actual unused import.

**swallowing errors silently in a deterministic code path** → Read [Error Handling Patterns](error-handling-patterns.md) first. Never suppress errors deterministically. Use best-effort (catch + log warning) only for truly optional operations. Use error-first (check + fail with remediation) for required operations.

**threading state through pipeline steps with mutable dataclasses** → Read [Land State Threading Pattern](land-state-threading.md) first. Use frozen dataclasses (@dataclass(frozen=True)) for pipeline state. Update fields with dataclasses.replace() to create new instances. Immutability enables caching, testability, and replay.

**tracking selection by array index when the array can be mutated** → Read [Selection Preservation by Value](selection-preservation-by-value.md) first. Track selection by unique identifier (plan_id, row key), not array position. Array indices become unstable when rows are added, removed, or reordered.

**trusting agent-produced JSON without normalization** → Read [Agent Schema Enforcement](agent-schema-enforcement.md) first. Agents drift from expected schemas over time. Always normalize at the boundary before validation. See normalize_tripwire_candidates.py for the pattern.

**try/except in fake.py or dry_run.py** [pattern: `\btry:|\bexcept\s`] → Read [Gateway Error Boundaries](gateway-error-boundaries.md) first. Gateway error handling (try/except) belongs ONLY in real.py. Fake and dry-run implementations return error discriminants based on constructor params, they don't catch exceptions.

**updating a roadmap step's PR cell** → Read [Roadmap Mutation Semantics](roadmap-mutation-semantics.md) first. The update-objective-node command computes display status from the PR value and writes it directly into the status cell. Status inference only happens during parsing when status is '-' or empty.

**using --force-with-lease in multi-step workflows where earlier steps push** → Read [Git and Graphite Edge Cases Catalog](git-graphite-quirks.md) first. Force-push silently overwrites intermediate commits from earlier workflow steps. Always `git pull --rebase` before pushing in multi-step workflows.

**using LiveDisplay in watch loops without try/finally blocks** → Read [LiveDisplay Gateway](live-display-gateway.md) first. guard with try/finally to ensure stop() is called even on KeyboardInterrupt

**using None as a success return value in a validation function (ErrorType | None where None = success)** → Read [Discriminated Union Error Handling](discriminated-union-error-handling.md) first. None-as-success is counterintuitive — None typically signals absence/failure, not success. Use ValidThing | InvalidThing so both outcomes are explicit named types.

**using Path.cwd() directly in an exec script without CWD injection** → Read [Command Composition Pattern](command-composition.md) first. Use `cwd: Path | None = None` parameter defaulting to `Path.cwd()` for testability. This allows tests to override the working directory.

**using PrContextProvider** → Read [Plan Context Integration](plan-context-integration.md) first. Read this doc first. PrContextProvider returns None on any failure (graceful degradation). Always handle the None case.

**using Protocol property descriptors on a frozen dataclass NonIdealState class** → Read [Discriminated Union Error Handling](discriminated-union-error-handling.md) first. Protocol property descriptors conflict with frozen dataclass fields. Use NonIdealStateMixin (at packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/non_ideal_state.py) when the NonIdealState class uses dataclass fields.

**using `--output-format stream-json` with `--print` in Claude CLI** [pattern: `--output-format\s+stream-json`] → Read [Claude CLI Integration from Python](claude-cli-integration.md) first. Must also include `--verbose`. Without it, the command fails with 'stream-json requires --verbose'.

**using `gt restack` to resolve branch divergence errors** [pattern: `gt\s+restack`] → Read [Git and Graphite Edge Cases Catalog](git-graphite-quirks.md) first. gt restack only handles parent-child stack rebasing, NOT same-branch remote divergence. Use git rebase origin/$BRANCH first.

**using bare subprocess.run with check=True** [pattern: `subprocess\.run\(`] → Read [Subprocess Wrappers](subprocess-wrappers.md) first. Use wrapper functions: run_subprocess_with_context() (gateway) or run_with_error_reporting() (CLI). Exception: Graceful degradation pattern with explicit CalledProcessError handling is acceptable for optional operations.

**using bash heredocs for large agent outputs** → Read [Heredoc Quoting and Escaping in Agent-Generated Bash](bash-python-integration.md) first. heredocs fail silently with special characters; prefer the Write tool

**using commit_files_to_branch plumbing without retracking** → Read [Git and Graphite Edge Cases Catalog](git-graphite-quirks.md) first. After commit_files_to_branch plumbing, always call retrack_branch() to keep Graphite in sync. The branch ref advances but Graphite's tracked SHA becomes stale.

**using gh api or gh api graphql to fetch or resolve PR review threads** → Read [GitHub API Rate Limits](github-api-rate-limits.md) first. Load `pr-operations` skill first. Use `erk exec get-pr-review-comments` and `erk exec resolve-review-thread` instead. Raw gh api calls miss thread resolution functionality.

**using gh codespace start** [pattern: `gh\s+codespace\s+start`] → Read [GitHub CLI Limits](github-cli-limits.md) first. gh codespace start does not exist. Use REST API POST /user/codespaces/{name}/start via gh api instead.

**using gh gist create with --filename flag** [pattern: `gh\s+gist\s+create.*--filename`] → Read [GitHub CLI Quirks and Edge Cases](github-cli-quirks.md) first. --filename only works with stdin input (-), not file paths.

**using gh issue create in production code** [pattern: `gh\s+issue\s+create`] → Read [GitHub API Rate Limits](github-api-rate-limits.md) first. Use REST API via `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues -X POST` instead. `gh issue create` uses GraphQL which has separate (often exhausted) rate limits.

**using gh issue edit in command documentation** [pattern: `gh\s+issue\s+edit`] → Read [GitHub API Rate Limits](github-api-rate-limits.md) first. Use `erk exec update-issue-body` instead. `gh issue edit` uses GraphQL which has separate (often exhausted) rate limits.

**using gh issue view in command documentation** [pattern: `gh\s+issue\s+view`] → Read [GitHub API Rate Limits](github-api-rate-limits.md) first. Use `erk exec get-issue-body` instead. `gh issue view` uses GraphQL which has separate (often exhausted) rate limits.

**using gh pr create in production code** [pattern: `gh\s+pr\s+create`] → Read [GitHub API Rate Limits](github-api-rate-limits.md) first. Use REST API via `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls -X POST` instead. `gh pr create` uses GraphQL which has separate (often exhausted) rate limits.

**using gh pr diff --name-only in production code** [pattern: `gh\s+pr\s+diff\s+--name-only`] → Read [GitHub CLI Limits](github-cli-limits.md) first. For PRs with 300+ files, gh pr diff fails with HTTP 406. Use REST API with pagination instead.

**using gh pr view --json merged** [pattern: `gh\s+pr\s+view.*--json.*\bmerged\b`] → Read [GitHub API Rate Limits](github-api-rate-limits.md) first. The `merged` field doesn't exist. Use `mergedAt` instead. Run `gh pr view --help` or check error output for valid field names.

**using git merge on a Graphite-managed branch** → Read [Git and Graphite Edge Cases Catalog](git-graphite-quirks.md) first. Merge commits break Graphite's linear stack model. Use git pull --rebase or gt sync. Merge commits cause gt squash divergence errors and broken parent tracking.

**using git pull or git pull --rebase on a Graphite-managed branch** [pattern: `git\s+pull`] → Read [Git and Graphite Edge Cases Catalog](git-graphite-quirks.md) first. Use /erk:diverge-fix instead. git pull --rebase rewrites commit SHAs outside Graphite's tracking, causing stack divergence that requires manual cleanup with gt sync --restack and force-push.

**using git stash in scripts that have running processes dependent on working tree state** → Read [Git Operation Patterns](git-operation-patterns.md) first. git stash changes working tree state which affects running processes. If code is executing from the working tree (e.g., Python scripts), stashing can cause import errors or missing file errors in the running process.

**using if/else on a discriminated union without isinstance() for type narrowing** → Read [Discriminated Union Error Handling](discriminated-union-error-handling.md) first. Type checkers require isinstance() for narrowing. 'if result.is_error' or 'if not result' does not narrow. Use 'if isinstance(result, ErrorType):' for correct narrowing in both branches.

**using monkeypatch to stub health check results in doctor tests** → Read [HealthCheckRunner Gateway Pattern](health-check-runner-gateway.md) first. Use FakeHealthCheckRunner with constructor-injected results instead. The HealthCheckRunner gateway eliminates all monkeypatch in doctor tests.

**using mutable list fields directly for mutation tracking in fakes** → Read [Fake Mutation Tracking](fake-mutation-tracking.md) first. Expose mutation tracking via @property returning tuple or .copy(). Internal lists should be private. See fake-mutation-tracking.md.

**using os.environ.get("CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID") in erk code** [pattern: `os\.environ.*CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`] → Read [Erk Architecture Patterns](erk-architecture.md) first. Erk code NEVER has access to this environment variable. Session IDs must be passed via --session-id CLI flags. Hooks receive session ID via stdin JSON, not environment variables.

**using run_ssh_command() for interactive commands** → Read [Composable Remote Commands Pattern](composable-remote-commands.md) first. Interactive commands need exec_ssh_interactive(), not run_ssh_command()

**using sed -i in scripts that run on both macOS and Linux** → Read [Subprocess Wrappers](subprocess-wrappers.md) first. macOS sed requires `sed -i ''` (empty string argument) while Linux sed uses `sed -i` (no argument). Scripts that use sed -i without handling this difference will fail silently on one platform.

**using subprocess.run with git command outside of a gateway** [pattern: `subprocess\.run\(\s*\[.*["']git`] → Read [Gateway ABC Implementation Checklist](gateway-abc-implementation.md) first. Use the Git gateway instead. Direct subprocess calls bypass testability (fakes) and dry-run support. The Git ABC (erk_shared.gateway.git.abc.Git) likely already has a method for this operation. Only use subprocess directly in real.py gateway implementations.

**using sync_branch_to_sha when merge-base analysis is needed** → Read [sync_branch_to_sha Pattern](sync-branch-to-sha-pattern.md) first. sync_branch_to_sha moves a branch to a known SHA. For trunk sync with divergence detection, use ensure_trunk_synced(). See sync-branch-to-sha-pattern.md.

**using this pattern** → Read [SSH Command Execution Patterns](ssh-command-execution.md) first. Using run_ssh_command() for interactive TUI processes causes apparent hangs

**using this pattern** → Read [SSH Command Execution Patterns](ssh-command-execution.md) first. SSH command must be a single string argument, not multiple shell words

**using this pattern** → Read [SSH Command Execution Patterns](ssh-command-execution.md) first. Missing -t flag prevents TTY allocation and breaks interactive programs

**using try/except KeyError for JSON field access** → Read [JSON Parsing Patterns](json-parsing-patterns.md) first. Use LBYL pattern: check field presence with `any(f not in data for f in _REQUIRED_FIELDS)` before accessing. Never use try/except for control flow.

**using two-dot syntax (branch..HEAD) in git diff** → Read [Git Operation Patterns](git-operation-patterns.md) first. git diff comparisons MUST use three-dot (branch...HEAD) to diff from merge-base. Two-dot is correct for git rev-list but WRONG for git diff.

**using unquoted heredoc delimiters (<<EOF) when the body contains $, \, or backticks** [pattern: `<<\s*EOF\b`] → Read [Heredoc Quoting and Escaping in Agent-Generated Bash](bash-python-integration.md) first. bash silently expands them

**using update_local_ref on a branch that might be checked out** → Read [Git Plumbing Patterns](git-plumbing-patterns.md) first. Use find_worktree_for_branch first. If checked out, use git pull --ff-only instead (updates ref + index + working tree). Ref-only updates on checked-out branches cause index desynchronization.

**using wildcard imports in the orchestrator **init**.py** → Read [Monolith-to-Subpackage Refactoring Pattern](monolith-to-subpackage-pattern.md) first. Use explicit imports for every submodule function. The import list doubles as a module index.

**validating object fields at every callsite instead of at construction** → Read [Erk Architecture Patterns](erk-architecture.md) first. Validate at the single construction point (factory/reader function). Callers should trust returned objects without re-validation. This is the construction boundary principle.

**writing LiveDisplay output to stdout** → Read [LiveDisplay Gateway](live-display-gateway.md) first. RealLiveDisplay writes to stderr by default (matches erk's user_output convention) — stdout is reserved for structured data

**writing a try-except block that wraps multiple independent operations** → Read [Error Handling Patterns](error-handling-patterns.md) first. Minimal exception scope: each try block should wrap only the single operation that can raise the caught exception. Split into separate try-except blocks with early returns. Broader scope is only acceptable when statements form an atomic unit (same message and recovery regardless of which line raises). See dignified-python references/exception-handling.md.

**writing complex business logic directly in Click command functions** → Read [CLI-to-Pipeline Boundary Pattern](cli-to-pipeline-boundary.md) first. Extract to pipeline layer when command has >3 distinct steps or complex state management. CLI layer should handle: Click decorators, parameter parsing, output formatting. Pipeline layer should handle: business logic, state management, error types.

**writing manual JSON serialization/deserialization for exec scripts** → Read [JSON/Dataclass Utilities in erk-shared](json-dataclass-utilities.md) first. Use @json_command or the utilities in erk_shared.agentclick.dataclass_json instead. They handle schema generation, type coercion, and error formatting automatically.

**writing multi-phase commands without testing in --print mode** → Read [Claude CLI Execution Modes](claude-cli-execution-modes.md) first. context: fork creates true isolation in interactive mode but loads inline in --print mode. Use Task tool for guaranteed isolation in all modes.

**writing tests for branch-scoped impl-context without configuring FakeGit** → Read [Impl-Folder Discovery Algorithm](impl-folder-discovery.md) first. FakeGit must be configured with current_branches={tmp_path: BRANCH} for resolve_impl_dir() to find branch-scoped directories. Without this, the branch_name parameter is None and discovery falls through to scan.
