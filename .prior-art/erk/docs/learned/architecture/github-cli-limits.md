# GitHub CLI Limits

The GitHub CLI wraps both REST and GraphQL APIs with command-line convenience. This abstraction occasionally conceals critical limitations — size thresholds, missing commands, and API quotas — that only surface under production load.

## Why gh pr diff Fails on Large PRs

`gh pr diff` fetches the entire diff in a single unbounded API request. GitHub's API rejects oversized diffs with HTTP 406, typically around 300+ changed files. The gh CLI provides no pagination option for this command.

This is a **test-vs-production tripwire**: small PRs work perfectly in development, large refactors fail silently in CI or production tooling.

### Failure Example

```bash
gh pr diff 123 --name-only
# Error: HTTP 406: Not Acceptable (https://api.github.com/...)
```

### The Solution: REST API with Pagination

Use the GitHub REST API `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/files` endpoint, which supports pagination:

```bash
gh api \
  --paginate \
  --jq '.[].filename' \
  "repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/${PR_NUMBER}/files"
```

### gh pr diff vs gh api Comparison

| Method                             | Pagination         | Size Limit | Failure Mode   |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------- | -------------- |
| `gh pr diff --name-only`           | No                 | ~300 files | HTTP 406 error |
| `gh api repos/.../pulls/.../files` | Yes (`--paginate`) | No limit   | None           |

### Decision: When to Use REST API Over gh pr Commands

| Use Case                     | Method                                                    | Reason                                            |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Get changed files (any size) | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/files --paginate` | REST API supports pagination, gh pr diff does not |
| Small PR diff (<100 files)   | `gh pr diff {pr}`                                         | Simpler command for common case                   |
| Large PR diff (300+ files)   | `gh api` with REST                                        | gh pr diff will HTTP 406                          |

The REST API approach is **always safe** — it works for all PR sizes. The gh pr diff convenience command is **conditionally safe** — fast path for small PRs, broken path for large ones.

<!-- Source: src/erk/cli/commands/exec/scripts/discover_reviews.py, discover_reviews command -->

See `RealGitHub.get_pr_changed_files()` in `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/github/real.py` for the production implementation using REST API with `--paginate`. The `discover_reviews` command in `src/erk/cli/commands/exec/scripts/discover_reviews.py` consumes this gateway method, demonstrating the pattern in a production exec script.

**Decision context**: PR #6119 fixed this after `erk exec discover-reviews` failed on large PRs. The original implementation worked in all manual testing (small PRs) but broke on the first large refactor.

## gh codespace start Does Not Exist

The GitHub CLI documentation implies `gh codespace start` exists. It does not. The command fails with "unknown command 'start'".

This is a **documentation-vs-implementation gap**: reasonable to expect based on `gh codespace stop`, but never implemented.

### Failure Example

```bash
gh codespace start mycodespace
# Error: unknown command "start" for "gh codespace"
```

### Workaround: Use REST API Directly

```bash
gh api \
  --method POST \
  "user/codespaces/${CODESPACE_NAME}/start"
```

This returns JSON with the codespace state. The operation is **asynchronous** — the API call returns immediately while the codespace continues starting. Callers must poll codespace state or implement retry logic with timeouts.

<!-- Source: packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/codespace/real.py, RealCodespace.start_codespace -->

See `RealCodespace.start_codespace()` in `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/codespace/real.py` for the production implementation using `gh api --method POST`.

## GH-API-AUDIT Convention

The codebase uses `GH-API-AUDIT` annotations to track gh CLI commands that could be replaced with direct REST or GraphQL API calls:

```python
# GH-API-AUDIT: [REST/GraphQL] - [operation description]
subprocess.run(["gh", "pr", "view", pr_number])
```

**Format**:

- `REST` — operation has a known REST API endpoint
- `GraphQL` — operation may be better served by GraphQL
- Operation description — brief explanation

### Examples from Codebase

```python
# GH-API-AUDIT: REST - Get PR number from branch
result = subprocess.run(["gh", "pr", "view", "--json", "number"])

# GH-API-AUDIT: GraphQL - Fetch issue comments
result = subprocess.run(["gh", "issue", "view", issue_number, "--json", "comments"])
```

**Purpose**: Identifies 60+ locations in the gateway code where we're using gh CLI abstractions that hide quota usage, lack features (like pagination), or impose size limits. The audit trail enables systematic migration when we encounter gh CLI limitations.

## Related Limitations

### GitHub Machines Endpoint HTTP 500 Bug

The `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/codespaces/machines` endpoint returns HTTP 500 for certain repositories (not all repos). The workaround uses `POST /user/codespaces` with `repository_id` instead of fetching available machine types first.

**Default machine type**: `premiumLinux` (hardcoded because the machines endpoint is unreliable)

**Full diagnostic methodology**: See [GitHub API Diagnostics](github-api-diagnostics.md) for repository-specific diagnostic patterns.

<!-- Source: src/erk/cli/commands/codespace/setup_cmd.py, default machine type selection -->

## Hardcoded --repo Flag Returns Empty Output

When using `gh api` with a hardcoded `--repo` flag (e.g., `--repo owner/repo`), the flag may silently return empty output if the repo format doesn't match what gh expects. Prefer letting gh infer the repo from the current git remote, or use the full API URL path (`repos/owner/repo/...`) instead.
