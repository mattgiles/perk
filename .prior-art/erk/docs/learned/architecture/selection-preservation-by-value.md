# Selection Preservation by Value

## The Problem

Array indices are fundamentally unstable when the underlying data can mutate. When a UI component refreshes its data (new rows inserted, existing rows removed, or reordering), tracking selection by position causes the cursor to jump to a different item or reset unexpectedly. The user loses their place.

This isn't a bug in any particular framework — it's a category error. Position is the wrong identity for items that can move.

## The Cross-Cutting Pattern

**Track selection by stable identifier, not array position.** After refreshing data:

1. Save the unique ID of the currently selected item (before refresh)
2. Repopulate the data structure
3. Search for the saved ID in the new data
4. Move cursor to its new position (or apply fallback if not found)

This pattern applies across UI frameworks (React, Textual, etc.) and data structures (arrays, DataTables, lists). The implementation details vary, but the underlying insight is universal.

## Why This Works

Stable identifiers survive mutations:

- **Insertion** — Item moves to different index, ID unchanged
- **Removal** — ID disappears from dataset (handled by fallback)
- **Reordering** — Item moves to different index, ID unchanged

Position-based tracking fails in all three cases. Value-based tracking only fails when the item is removed, which is the one case where "lose your place" is semantically correct.

## Implementation: Python/Textual

<!-- Source: src/erk/tui/widgets/plan_table.py, PlanDataTable.populate -->

See `PlanDataTable.populate()` in `src/erk/tui/widgets/plan_table.py` (lines 149-185). The pattern:

- Save `selected_key` (stringified `plan_id`) before `clear()`
- Also save `saved_cursor_row` as secondary fallback
- Loop through new rows to find matching `plan_id`
- If found, move cursor to that row
- If not found, clamp saved index to valid range

**Two-tier fallback**: This implementation prefers value-based restoration but accepts position-based as a fallback. The LBYL bounds check prevents invalid cursor positions when the list shrinks.

**Why both fallbacks**: The Textual implementation prioritizes "stay near where you were" over "reset to top". Different UX goal than React version.

## Fallback Strategy Decision Table

When the selected item disappears from the refreshed data, you must choose a fallback behavior:

| Strategy        | UX Intent                                 | When to Use                            |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Reset to 0      | User should see latest/most important     | Priority-sorted lists (newest first)   |
| Preserve index  | User should see nearby context            | Navigable lists where position matters |
| Clear selection | Selection is meaningless without the item | Optional selection states              |

**Erk's choices:**

- **erk TUI**: Preserve index, clamped — user is navigating a stable list, context matters

## Historical Context

The generalized insight: **Mutable data structures need stable identity, not positional identity.** This applies beyond UI — any time you're tracking "which one" in a collection that can change.
