# Rebase Conflict Patterns

Rebase operations can introduce subtle regressions in files that don't show as conflicts. This document covers patterns for preventing and detecting these issues.

## Hidden Regressions in Non-Conflicted Files

After a rebase, git marks files with textual conflicts for manual resolution. However, **semantic** conflicts in non-conflicted files go undetected:

- A function was renamed in the base branch, but call sites in your branch still use the old name
- A type signature changed, but your branch's callers pass the old argument types
- A module was moved, but your branch imports from the old location

These don't produce merge markers — git considers the files cleanly merged because the changes don't overlap textually.

## Prevention: Grep Before Running Tests

After resolving all textual conflicts:

```bash
# Check for old symbols that should have been renamed
grep -r "old_function_name" src/ tests/

# Check for old module paths
grep -r "from old_module" src/ tests/

# Then run tests
make test
```

## Auto-Generated File Resolution

Some files are auto-generated (e.g., `tripwires.md`, `index.md`). For these:

1. Accept either version during conflict resolution
2. Run the regeneration command after resolving all conflicts:
   ```bash
   erk docs sync
   ```
3. The regenerated file will be correct based on current frontmatter state

## Resolve-Conflicts Command

`erk pr resolve-conflicts` handles the Claude TUI phase of conflict resolution. It requires a rebase already in progress — it does not initiate a rebase.

**Workflow:**

1. User runs `git rebase <branch>` or `gt restack --no-interactive` until conflicts arise
2. User runs `erk pr resolve-conflicts`
3. Command verifies rebase in progress via `is_rebase_in_progress()`
4. Shows conflicted files, asks for confirmation
5. Launches Claude Code interactively with `/erk:pr-resolve-conflicts` for AI-assisted resolution
