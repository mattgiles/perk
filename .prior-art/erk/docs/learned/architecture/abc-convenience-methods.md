# ABC Convenience Method Pattern

Gateway ABCs can include **concrete (non-abstract) convenience methods** that compose primitive operations. These methods are defined once in the ABC and inherited by all implementations.

## When to Use

Use this pattern when:

- A common operation composes multiple primitive methods
- Error handling logic is complex and should be centralized
- You want to provide an ergonomic API without adding abstract methods

## Canonical Example

See `squash_branch_idempotent()` in `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/graphite/abc.py`. This wraps the primitive `squash_branch()` with idempotent error handling, returning a discriminated union (`SquashSuccess | SquashError`) instead of raising.

## Exception Type Compatibility

Real and fake implementations may raise different exception types:

| Implementation | Exception Type                  | Source                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Real           | `RuntimeError`                  | `run_subprocess_with_context()` |
| Fake           | `subprocess.CalledProcessError` | Direct raise for testing        |

**Solution**: Catch both types in the convenience method. See the `except` clause in `squash_branch_idempotent()` for the pattern.

## Benefits Over Abstract Methods

| Aspect         | Abstract Method (3-4 files) | Convenience Method (1 file) |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Implementation | abc, real, fake, dry_run    | abc only                    |
| Maintenance    | High (3-4 places to update) | Low (1 place)               |
| Testing        | Needs fake behavior         | Uses existing primitives    |
| Use case       | New primitive operation     | Composing existing ops      |

## When NOT to Use

Don't use convenience methods when:

- The operation requires implementation-specific behavior
- Performance characteristics differ between real/fake
- The operation needs dry-run wrapper behavior

In those cases, add an abstract method following the [Gateway ABC Implementation Checklist](gateway-abc-implementation.md).

## Git vs Graphite View Divergence

Git commit counts (against trunk) can differ from Graphite's view (against parent branch) when local master hasn't been updated. The idempotent pattern handles this gracefully — "nothing to squash" is treated as success.
