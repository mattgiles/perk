# GitHub GraphQL Label Semantics

GitHub's GraphQL API uses AND semantics for label filter arrays — not OR. This is undocumented and causes silent data loss when queries expect OR behavior.

## The Problem

When you pass `labels: ["erk-pr", "erk-learn"]` to a GitHub GraphQL query, GitHub returns only issues that have **both** labels, not issues with **either** label. This is the opposite of what most developers expect.

## Silent Failure Mode

There is no error, no warning — you simply get fewer results than expected. This makes the bug difficult to detect because:

1. Some items may legitimately have both labels, so results aren't empty
2. The missing items are invisible — you don't know what you're not seeing
3. Tests with small datasets may pass if test items happen to have all labels

## Decision: Query by Type-Specific Labels

Because of AND semantics, erk queries by **type-specific** labels only:

| View       | Query Label     | NOT base label |
| ---------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| Plans      | `erk-pr`        | —              |
| Learn      | `erk-learn`     | —              |
| Objectives | `erk-objective` | N/A            |

## Impact

This affects all `gh api graphql` calls that include label filters, including:

- TUI view data fetching (Plans, Learn, Objectives tabs)
- CLI plan listing (`erk pr list`)
- Any GraphQL query with the `labels` parameter
