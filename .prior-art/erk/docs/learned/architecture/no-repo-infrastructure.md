# No-Repo Infrastructure

Erk commands normally require a git repository context. The no-repo infrastructure allows specific commands to run outside repositories by providing sentinel gateways that raise user-friendly errors instead of crashing.

## NoRepoSentinel Pattern

Sentinel gateways implement the same ABC interfaces as real gateways but raise `NoRepoError` with guidance when called. This means commands can be wired up normally — the error only fires if the command actually tries to use repo-dependent functionality.

## `@no_repo_required` Decorator

Commands decorated with `@no_repo_required` skip repository detection during context construction. Instead of failing at startup when no repo is found, the context is built with sentinel gateways for repo-dependent services.

## RemoteGitHub Consolidation

<!-- Source: src/erk/cli/commands/one_shot.py -->

The one-shot dispatch command demonstrates the full no-repo pattern. It supports both local repo mode and remote-only mode via `--repo owner/name`:

### Context Injection Pattern

`_get_remote_github()` in `one_shot.py` provides a factory for `RemoteGitHub`:

1. If `ctx.remote_github` is already set (test injection), return it
2. If no `ctx.http_client` available, raise `UserFacingCliError`
3. Otherwise, construct `RealRemoteGitHub(http_client=ctx.http_client, time=ctx.time)`

### Repo Resolution

The `--repo` flag handler validates the `owner/repo` format (must contain exactly one `/`), falls back to local repo detection when not provided, and guards with `isinstance(ctx.repo, NoRepoSentinel)` when no `--repo` flag is given.

### Error Handling

- `--repo` format validation: rejects malformed `owner/repo` strings
- Mutual exclusivity: `--repo` and `--ref-current` cannot be used together (current ref requires a local repo)
