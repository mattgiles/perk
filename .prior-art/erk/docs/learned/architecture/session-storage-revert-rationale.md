# Session Storage Architecture

Sessions are stored on dedicated git branches and referenced via plan metadata. This design evolved through a same-day iteration cycle.

## Current Implementation

`push_session.py` preprocesses session JSONL to compressed XML and pushes to a `planned-pr-context/{pr_number}` branch, accumulating multiple sessions across lifecycle stages. Plan metadata is updated with:

| Metadata Field        | Value                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `last_session_branch` | `planned-pr-context/{pr_number}` |
| `last_session_id`     | Claude Code session ID           |
| `last_session_at`     | ISO timestamp                    |
| `last_session_source` | `"local"` or `"remote"`          |

## Historical Context

- **PR #7757**: Migrated sessions from gists to branch-based storage (initial attempt)
- **PR #7765**: Reverted the migration on the same day due to reliability issues
- **Current state**: Branch-based storage via `push_session.py` with `planned-pr-context/{pr_number}` branches — a refined approach that addressed the earlier issues

The current implementation differs from the reverted one in its use of dedicated `planned-pr-context/` branches (isolated from feature branches) and atomic force-push semantics.

## Code Location

`src/erk/cli/commands/exec/scripts/push_session.py` — full push flow including preprocessing, branch creation, session accumulation, and metadata update.
