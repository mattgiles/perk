# GitHub Actions API Interaction Patterns

Erk relies heavily on the GitHub Actions API for its remote execution model — dispatching workflows, tracking run status, and correlating triggers to runs. This document captures the cross-cutting patterns that span the gateway layer, workflow YAML, and CLI commands.

For GitHub Actions YAML syntax (triggers, expressions, permissions), see the [Workflow YAML DSL Reference](#workflow-yaml-dsl-reference) section below and [GitHub's workflow syntax docs](https://docs.github.com/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions). For erk-specific workflow composition patterns (compound conditions, step ID mismatches), see `docs/learned/ci/github-actions-workflow-patterns.md`.

## The distinct_id Correlation Problem

GitHub's `workflow_dispatch` API has a fundamental gap: triggering a workflow returns no run ID. The caller knows the workflow was triggered but has no way to find the resulting run. This is because `workflow_dispatch` is asynchronous — the API returns 204 No Content, and the run appears on the server some time later (typically 1-5 seconds, but up to 30+ seconds under load).

Erk solves this with a **distinct_id correlation pattern**:

1. `trigger_workflow` generates a random 6-character base36 ID
2. The ID is injected as a `distinct_id` workflow input
3. Every erk workflow uses `run-name` to embed the ID in its display title
4. `trigger_workflow` polls `gh run list` and matches on `displayTitle` containing `:<distinct_id>`

The `run-name` convention across all erk workflows follows this pattern:

```yaml
# Third-party API pattern: run-name convention for run correlation
run-name: "${{ inputs.issue_number }}:${{ inputs.distinct_id }}"
run-name: "pr-address:#${{ inputs.pr_number }}:${{ inputs.distinct_id }}"
run-name: "rebase:${{ inputs.branch_name }}:${{ inputs.distinct_id }}"
```

The colon-delimited format allows `trigger_workflow` to search for `:<distinct_id>` without false-positive matches on issue numbers or branch names.

<!-- Source: packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/github/abc.py, GitHub.trigger_workflow -->

See `RealGitHub.trigger_workflow()` in `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/github/real.py` for the implementation. The polling uses an adaptive delay strategy: 5 fast attempts (1s each), then 10 slower attempts (2s each), totaling ~25 seconds before timeout.

## REST vs GraphQL Decision

The GitHub gateway uses two API surfaces for workflow queries. The choice is driven by query cardinality:

| Scenario                         | API                              | Why                                     |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Single run by ID                 | REST (`actions/runs/{id}`)       | Direct lookup, includes `node_id` field |
| List runs for workflow           | REST via `gh run list`           | Paginated, supports `--user` filter     |
| Batch query N runs by node ID    | GraphQL `nodes(ids: [...])`      | O(1) API call vs O(N) REST calls        |
| Run status for multiple branches | REST (fetch all, filter locally) | GraphQL schema lacks branch filtering   |

The GraphQL batch pattern is critical for the `erk pr list` command, which shows workflow status for many plans simultaneously. Without batching, displaying 20 plans would require 20 individual REST calls.

**Anti-pattern**: Using `get_workflow_run` in a loop. If you have multiple run IDs, store their GraphQL node IDs and use `get_workflow_runs_by_node_ids` instead.

<!-- Source: packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/github/real.py, RealGitHub.get_workflow_runs_by_node_ids -->

See `RealGitHub.get_workflow_runs_by_node_ids()` in `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/github/real.py` for the GraphQL batch implementation. Note the critical `gh api graphql` array syntax: `-f nodeIds[]=val1 -f nodeIds[]=val2` (not JSON-encoded array).

## Workflow Run Priority Selection

When displaying workflow status for a branch (e.g., in `erk pr list`), multiple runs may exist. The gateway selects the "most relevant" run using a priority hierarchy:

1. **Active runs** (in_progress, queued) — the current state matters most
2. **Failed runs** — failures are more actionable than successes
3. **Successful runs** — most recent

This ordering reflects erk's operator-facing design: if something is running, show that; if something failed, surface the failure; only show success as the fallback.

<!-- Source: packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/github/real.py, RealGitHub.get_workflow_runs_by_branches -->

See `RealGitHub.get_workflow_runs_by_branches()` in `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/github/real.py` for the full priority logic.

## WorkflowRun Field Availability

The `WorkflowRun` type has fields that vary in availability depending on which API fetched the data. This is a cross-cutting concern that affects any code consuming workflow run data.

| Field           | REST API                                  | GraphQL nodes()                                            |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `run_id`        | Available                                 | Available (as `databaseId`)                                |
| `status`        | Available                                 | Available (via `checkSuite.status`, requires mapping)      |
| `conclusion`    | Available                                 | Available (via `checkSuite.conclusion`, requires mapping)  |
| `branch`        | Available                                 | **Not available** — sentinel raises `AttributeError`       |
| `display_title` | Available                                 | **Not available** — sentinel raises `AttributeError`       |
| `head_sha`      | Available                                 | Available (via `checkSuite.commit.oid`)                    |
| `node_id`       | Available (REST `actions/runs/{id}` only) | Available as dict key (not in `WorkflowRun.node_id` field) |

The sentinel pattern (`_NotAvailable`) ensures accessing unavailable fields fails loudly rather than returning None silently. Code consuming `WorkflowRun` objects must know which API path produced them.

#### Operators

```yaml
# Comparison
==, !=, <, <=, >, >=

# Logical
&&, ||, !

# Indexing
github.event.commits[0].message
matrix['node-version']
```

#### Common Patterns

```yaml
# Conditional step
if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'

# Check for label
if: contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'deploy')

# Run on failure
if: failure()

# Run even if cancelled
if: always()

# Skip if cancelled
if: "!cancelled()"
```

### Reusable Workflows

#### Caller Workflow

```yaml
jobs:
  call-workflow:
    uses: org/repo/.github/workflows/reusable.yml@main
    with:
      config: production
    secrets:
      token: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_TOKEN }}
    # Or inherit all secrets
    secrets: inherit
```

#### Reusable Workflow

```yaml

  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      config:
        required: true
        type: string
    outputs:

    outputs:
      result: ${{ steps.step1.outputs.result }}
    steps:
      - run: echo "Config: ${{ inputs.config }}"
```
