# External Plans Repository Configuration

Configure erk to store plans in a separate repository from your working repository.

## Configuration

In `.erk/config.toml`:

```toml
[github]
repo = "owner/repo"
```

**Format:** `"owner/repo"` - the GitHub repository where plans will be created.

**Example:**

```toml
[github]
repo = "myorg/engineering-plans"
```

## Effect

When `plans.repo` is set:

- Plans are created in the target repository instead of the working repository
- `erk implement` fetches plans from the target repository
- `erk doctor` checks that required labels exist in the target repository

## Required Labels

Erk uses these labels to organize plans:

| Label           | Color              | Description                        |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `erk-pr`        | `#0E8A16` (green)  | Implementation plan PR             |
| `erk-learn`     | `#D93F0B` (orange) | Documentation extraction plan PR   |
| `erk-objective` | `#5319E7` (purple) | Multi-phase objective with roadmap |

### Automatic Label Setup

When you run `erk init` with `plans.repo` configured, erk will offer to create these labels in the target repository. You need write access to the target repository.

### Manual Label Setup

If automatic setup fails, create labels manually in GitHub:

1. Go to your target repository's Issues tab
2. Click "Labels" in the sidebar
3. Create each label with the name, color, and description from the table above

## Use Cases

**Centralized planning:** Store all plans in a dedicated repository while implementing in multiple code repositories.

**Team visibility:** Keep plans visible to the team without cluttering the code repository's issue tracker.

**Access separation:** Allow broader access to plans while restricting code repository access.

## Verification

Run `erk doctor` to verify the setup:

```bash
erk doctor
```

Look for the "pr-repo-labels" check. If labels are missing, the check will fail with instructions to fix.
