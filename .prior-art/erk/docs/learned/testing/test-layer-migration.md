# Test Layer Migration

When to move tests between unit and integration layers, and how to do it.

## When to Migrate

Move a test from unit to integration when it:

- Calls real `create_context()` (performs real I/O, reads config files)
- Scans filesystem trees (reads directories, walks paths)
- Uses real git operations (creates repos, runs git commands)
- Depends on external tools being installed

## Migration Process

1. Identify tests that perform real I/O in unit layer
2. Move test file to `tests/integration/`
3. Verify no real I/O remains in the unit test directory
4. Ensure moved tests pass in integration suite (`make test-integration`)

## Example: test_forward_references.py

`test_forward_references.py` was moved from unit to integration because it called `create_context()` which performs real filesystem operations. Three context-dependent tests were extracted alongside it.

## Gateway Extension Pattern

See [Gateway ABC Implementation](../architecture/gateway-abc-implementation.md) for the 5-place pattern (ABC, Real, Fake, Dry-run, Printing).
