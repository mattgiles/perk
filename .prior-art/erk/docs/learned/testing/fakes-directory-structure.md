# Fakes Directory Structure

Test fakes in erk live in `tests/fakes/`, not in production code under `src/`.

## Directory Layout

```
tests/
└── fakes/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── gateway/           # Fake gateway implementations
    │   └── ...            # FakeGit, FakeGitHub, etc.
    └── tests/             # Test-specific doubles
        ├── health_check_runner.py    # FakeHealthCheckRunner
        ├── parallel_task_runner.py   # FakeParallelTaskRunner
        ├── tui_plan_data_provider.py # FakePrDataProvider
        └── ...
```

## Why Not `src/`?

Production code should not depend on test infrastructure. Placing fakes in `src/` would:

1. Increase the production package size
2. Create circular dependencies (production code importing test tools)
3. Violate the principle that `src/` contains only deployable artifacts

## Where to Put New Fakes

| Fake Type                                    | Location               |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Gateway fake (FakeGit, FakeGitHub, etc.)     | `tests/fakes/gateway/` |
| Test-specific double for a service/component | `tests/fakes/tests/`   |
