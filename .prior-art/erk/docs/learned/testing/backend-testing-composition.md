# Backend Testing Composition

Pattern for testing code that uses Backend ABCs. The key insight: inject fake gateways into real backends, rather than creating fake backends.

## Core Pattern

```python
# Correct: real backend with fake gateway
fake_github = FakeLocalGitHub()
fake_issues = FakeGitHubIssues()
backend = ManagedGitHubPrBackend(fake_github, fake_issues, time=FakeTime())

# Wrong: fake backend for testing callers
fake_backend = FakeManagedPrBackend()  # Only for ABC contract tests
```

### Why Real Backend + Fake Gateway

Backends contain business logic (metadata block formatting, comment rendering, event composition). Faking the backend bypasses this logic, making tests less valuable. By using the real backend with a fake gateway:

1. Business logic in the backend is exercised
2. Gateway interactions (API calls) are captured by the fake
3. Tests verify the full call chain from caller -> backend -> gateway

## Example: Testing impl_signal.py

From `tests/unit/cli/commands/exec/scripts/test_impl_signal.py`:

See `test_started_posts_comment_and_updates_metadata` in
[`tests/unit/cli/commands/exec/scripts/test_impl_signal.py`](../../../tests/unit/cli/commands/exec/scripts/test_impl_signal.py)
for the full test. The key elements:

- Creates a `FakeLocalGitHub` with test PRs
- Invokes `impl_signal` via `CliRunner` with `ErkContext.for_test(github=fake_github)`
- Asserts on `fake_github.pr_comments`, `fake_github.updated_pr_bodies`, `fake_github.updated_pr_titles`, etc.

## When to Use Fake Backends

Fake backends are appropriate only for validating the ABC contract itself across different providers. For example, ensuring both `ManagedGitHubPrBackend` and a hypothetical alternative backend implement the same interface correctly.

## Decision Table

| Testing Scenario                | Approach                    |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Caller uses backend methods     | Real backend + fake gateway |
| Backend ABC contract validation | Fake backend                |
| Gateway method behavior         | Fake gateway directly       |

## Assertion Pattern

Assert on fake gateway mutation tracking properties:

| Property                          | What It Tracks                                      |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `fake_github.pr_comments`         | List of `(pr_number, body)` tuples                  |
| `fake_github.updated_pr_bodies`   | List of `(pr_number, new_body)` tuples              |
| `fake_github.updated_pr_titles`   | List of `(pr_number, new_title)` tuples             |
| `fake_github.updated_pr_bases`    | List of `(pr_number, new_base)` tuples              |
| `fake_github.created_prs`         | List of `(branch, title, body, base, draft)` tuples |
| `fake_github.added_labels`        | List of `(pr_number, label)` tuples                 |
| `fake_github.merged_prs`          | List of merged PR numbers                           |
| `fake_github.closed_prs`          | List of closed PR numbers                           |
| `fake_github.resolved_thread_ids` | Set of resolved review thread IDs                   |
