# Environment Variable Isolation in Tests

## The `ERK_PR_BACKEND` Contamination Pattern

> **Note:** After PR #7971 (objective #7911 node 1.1), the `get_plan_backend()` function was deleted and the plan backend is hardcoded to `"planned_pr"`. The `ERK_PR_BACKEND` environment variable is no longer read by application code. The contamination pattern described below is historical but the mitigations remain relevant until vestigial code paths are fully cleaned up in later nodes of objective #7911.

Previously, setting `ERK_PR_BACKEND=planned_pr` in the shell environment caused **125+ test failures** when running the full test suite.

### Root Cause

`context_for_test()` in `tests/fakes/tests/shared_context.py` creates a test `ErkContext`. After PR #7971, the plan backend selection uses a tautological comparison that always takes the planned-PR path, regardless of environment variables. Tests that set `ERK_PR_BACKEND` are now exercising dead code paths. Monkeypatching this variable has no behavioral effect.

<!-- Source: tests/fakes/tests/shared_context.py, context_for_test -->

See `context_for_test()` in `tests/fakes/tests/shared_context.py`.

## `context_for_test()` Implementation

After PR #8210, `context_for_test()` in `tests/fakes/tests/shared_context.py` no longer checks `ERK_PR_BACKEND`. The plan backend is hardcoded to `ManagedGitHubPrBackend`.

## Mitigations

### Option 1: `monkeypatch.delenv()` in test fixtures

```python
@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def clear_pr_backend_env(monkeypatch: pytest.MonkeyPatch) -> None:
    monkeypatch.delenv("ERK_PR_BACKEND", raising=False)
```

Use `autouse=True` in a `conftest.py` to apply across all tests in a module.

### Option 2: Explicit `pr_store` in test context

Pass `pr_store` explicitly to `context_for_test()`:

```python
ctx = context_for_test(
    pr_store=ManagedGitHubPrBackend(FakeLocalGitHub(), FakeGitHubIssues(), time=FakeTime()),
    ...
)
```

### Option 3: `env_overrides` in test fixtures (if available)

Some test infrastructure supports `env_overrides={"ERK_PR_BACKEND": "github"}` to force the value.

## Diagnosis Steps

If you see 100+ unexpected failures:

1. Check `echo $ERK_PR_BACKEND` — if it's `planned_pr`, that's the cause
2. Unset it: `unset ERK_PR_BACKEND`
3. Re-run the failing tests to confirm they pass
4. Add a fixture to isolate tests from the env var going forward
