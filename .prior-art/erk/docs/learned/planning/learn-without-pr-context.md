# Learn Without PR Context

## Why This Matters

The learn pipeline extracts documentation insights from plan sessions. The richest input includes both session XML _and_ PR review comments (inline threads + discussion), but a PR doesn't always exist when learn runs. Plans may be in-progress, abandoned, consolidated into a different PR, or implemented for local testing only.

Treating missing PR context as an error would block learn from running in these valid scenarios. The pipeline is designed so that sessions alone — containing the planning rationale and implementation decisions — provide sufficient material for insight extraction. PR review comments are enrichment, not a prerequisite.

## Graceful Degradation Architecture

The `trigger-async-learn` orchestrator resolves the plan's PR through a chain of lookups: issue → metadata block → branch name → PR. Each step returns `None` on failure, and the entire PR comment-fetching block is gated on the result.

When PR lookup returns `None`, the orchestrator logs a warning and skips PR comment fetching. No review comments or discussion comments are written to the learn materials directory. The downstream learn agent receives only preprocessed session XML — which still contains all planning rationale, implementation decisions, and tool interactions.

When a PR _is_ found, the orchestrator fetches two separate comment types via gateway calls (not `gh` CLI):

| Comment type        | File written                  | Contains                                  |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Review threads      | `pr-review-comments.json`     | Inline code review threads with file/line |
| Discussion comments | `pr-discussion-comments.json` | Top-level PR conversation                 |

Both use LBYL discriminated union checking (`isinstance(result, PRNotFound)`) rather than exception handling, consistent with erk's error patterns.

## Valid No-PR Scenarios

Not all plan implementations produce PRs:

- **Work in progress** — implementation isn't ready for review yet
- **Abandoned plans** — decided not to proceed after implementation
- **Consolidated work** — plan's changes merged into a different PR
- **Local testing** — no intent to merge (e.g., testing the learn workflow itself)

The learn pipeline must work identically in all cases. The quality difference is additive: PR comments enrich output but their absence doesn't degrade what sessions provide.

## Anti-Patterns

**Assuming PR always exists**: Any code in the learn pipeline that calls gateway PR methods without first checking the PR lookup result will crash on no-PR plans. The existing orchestrator gates all PR operations behind a single `None` check — new PR-dependent steps must live inside that same gate.

**Using `gh` CLI for PR detection in Python**: The orchestrator uses typed gateway calls with discriminated union returns, not subprocess calls to `gh`. This provides type safety and LBYL error handling. Don't mix the two approaches.
