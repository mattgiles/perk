# Next Steps Output Formatting

After saving a plan, erk displays next-steps commands to the user. The formatting is centralized in a single module with one dataclass.

## Source

`packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/output/next_steps.py`

## Dataclass

### `PrNextSteps`

Takes `pr_number: int`, `branch_name: str`, and `url: str`.

Properties return pre-formatted command strings. See the source file for the full list of available properties.

## Hierarchical Output Format

The plain-text formatter (`format_pr_next_steps_plain`) produces a hierarchical format with three sections: "Implement plan" (with branch/worktree and dangerous variants), "Checkout plan" (branch/worktree), and "Dispatch plan".

## Shell Activation Pattern

The `new_wt` variants use the `source <(erk ... --script)` pattern because they create a new worktree and need to navigate the shell there. This is required because subprocess directory changes don't persist to the calling shell.

The `current_wt` variants use a simple `&&` chain (`erk br co --for-pr N && erk implement`) since the user is already in the correct directory — no shell activation is needed.

See [Shell Activation Pattern](../cli/shell-activation-pattern.md) for the full explanation.

## Format Functions

| Function                       | Context                         | Output format |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `format_pr_next_steps_plain()` | CLI output, exit-plan-mode-hook | Plain text    |
| `format_next_steps_markdown()` | PR body                         | Markdown      |

Note: The `format_pr_next_steps_plain()` function takes `pr_number`, `branch_name`, and `url` as parameters.

`format_pr_next_steps_plain()` is called in `exit_plan_mode_hook.py` when handling the plan-saved marker (Step 2 "what next?" output shown after saving a plan).

## Step 2 Blocking Message (`build_step2_message`)

<!-- Source: src/erk/cli/commands/exec/scripts/exit_plan_mode_hook.py, build_step2_message -->

After plan-save completes, the exit-plan-mode hook detects the plan-saved marker and enters Step 2. The `build_step2_message()` function (in `exit_plan_mode_hook.py`) builds a blocking message that:

1. Announces "Plan #N saved successfully"
2. Displays all next-steps commands via `format_pr_next_steps_plain()`
3. Instructs Claude to display the commands verbatim (not summarized)
4. Ends with "Session complete. Do NOT call ExitPlanMode again."

### PR-Saved Marker Format

<!-- Source: packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/scratch/session_markers.py, read_plan_saved_marker -->

The marker file `exit-plan-mode-hook.plan-saved.marker` stores the PR number on its first line. `read_plan_saved_marker()` in `session_markers.py` reads this file and returns `int | None`.

The marker path is determined by `read_plan_saved_marker()` — see the source for current details.

## `PrNumberEvent`

<!-- Source: packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/core/prompt_executor.py, PrNumberEvent -->

`PrNumberEvent` is a typed event emitted by the prompt executor when Claude's output contains a PR number. See `PrNumberEvent` in `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/core/prompt_executor.py` for the frozen dataclass definition.

`PrNumberEvent.number` is a proper `int` (no string conversion needed). Both `PrNumberEvent` (for created/updated PRs) and `PlanNumberEvent` (for plan numbers) are in `erk_shared.core.prompt_executor` and are part of the `ExecutorEvent` union.

## Slash Command Constants

Two module-level slash command constants are defined but not directly used in any formatter. The plain-text formatter uses the `dispatch_slash_command` property on `PlanNextSteps` instead:

- `DISPATCH_SLASH_COMMAND = "/erk:pr-dispatch"` — not used in any formatter (the instance property `dispatch_slash_command` is used instead)
- `CHECKOUT_SLASH_COMMAND = "/erk:prepare"` — not used in any formatter
