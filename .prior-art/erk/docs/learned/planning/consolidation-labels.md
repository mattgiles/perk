# Consolidation Labels

## Why This Exists

Learn plan consolidation has a circular reference problem: `/local:replan-learn-plans` queries all open `erk-learn` plans and merges them into a single new plan — which itself carries the `erk-learn` label. Without protection, the next consolidation run would pick up its own output, creating an infinite loop of consolidation.

The `erk-consolidated` label breaks this cycle. It acts as a "already processed" marker: the consolidation query fetches `erk-learn` plans, then filters out any that also carry `erk-consolidated`.

## The Single-vs-Multi Decision

The label is **only** applied during multi-plan consolidation, never during single-plan replans. This distinction matters because:

- **Multi-plan consolidation** creates a new plan that _replaces_ multiple source plans. It must not be re-consolidated because it already represents a merge.
- **Single-plan replan** creates a new plan that _supersedes_ one source plan. It's a fresh plan against current codebase state and should remain eligible for future consolidation with other plans.

<!-- Source: .claude/commands/erk/replan.md, Step 7 item 4 -->

The label application happens in Step 7 of `/erk:replan`, after the new plan is created via `/erk:plan-save`.

<!-- Source: .claude/commands/local/replan-learn-plans.md, Step 1b -->

The filtering happens early in `/local:replan-learn-plans` (Step 1b) to avoid wasting API calls investigating plans that will be skipped.

## Label Lifecycle

A plan accumulates labels through its lifecycle — `erk-consolidated` is additive, not a replacement:

1. `/erk:learn` creates plan → labeled `erk-learn`
2. `/local:replan-learn-plans` consolidates N plans → new plan labeled `erk-learn` + `erk-consolidated` + `erk-pr`
3. Original N plans are closed with a cross-reference comment
4. Future consolidation runs skip the `erk-consolidated` plan automatically

The `erk-pr` label is added during consolidation (Step 7.4 of `/erk:replan`) to make consolidated plans dispatchable via `erk pr dispatch`, which requires this label.

## Edge Case: All Plans Already Consolidated

When `/local:replan-learn-plans` finds open `erk-learn` plans but every one has `erk-consolidated`, it reports this state and stops — there's nothing new to consolidate. This is a normal steady-state condition after a consolidation has run and no new learn plans have been created since.
