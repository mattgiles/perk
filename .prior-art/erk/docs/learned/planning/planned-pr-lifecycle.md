# Planned PR Lifecycle

Planned PRs serve as the backing store for plans. Plans evolve through lifecycle stages within a single PR.

## Stage Definitions

### Stage 1: Plan Creation

`plan_save` / `PlannedPRBackend.create_plan()` creates a draft PR with `lifecycle_stage: planned` in the plan-header metadata. The body contains the plan-header metadata block, the plan content collapsed in a `<details>` tag, an optional AI-generated summary, and a checkout footer.

Body format:

```
[optional AI-generated summary]

<details>
<summary>original-plan</summary>

[plan content]

</details>
\n\n
[metadata block]
\n---\n
[checkout footer]
```

The summary is generated during `/erk:plan-save` (Step 1.75) as a 2-3 sentence plain-text overview. When provided, it appears above the collapsed plan details, visible without expanding. When absent, the body starts directly with `<details>`.

### Stage 2: Implementation

After code changes, `erk pr submit` / `erk pr rewrite` rewrites the body. The metadata block is preserved. The AI-generated summary is inserted before the collapsed plan.

Body format:

```
[AI-generated summary]

<details>
<summary>original-plan</summary>

[plan content]

</details>
\n\n
[metadata block]
\n---\n
[checkout footer]
```

### Stage 3: Review & Merge

PR is marked ready for review. Standard review/merge flow. No body format changes in this stage.

## Key Functions

All in `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/pr_store/planned_pr_lifecycle.py`:

| Function                                                         | Purpose                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `build_plan_stage_body(metadata_body, plan_content, *, summary)` | Build Stage 1 body: details-wrapped plan + metadata. Optional `summary: str \| None` prepends before `<details>`. Footer NOT included (needs PR number). |
| `build_original_pr_section(plan_content)`                        | Wrap plan content in `<details><summary>original-plan</summary>` section. Used by both Stage 1 and Stage 2.                                              |
| `extract_plan_content(pr_body)`                                  | Extract plan content from PR body at any lifecycle stage. Handles both details-wrapped and old flat format. Summary is NOT included in output.           |
| `find_metadata_block(pr_body, "plan-header")`                    | Extract metadata block for preservation during stage transitions.                                                                                        |

## Separator Semantics

Two distinct separators serve different purposes:

- **Content separator** (`\n\n---\n\n`, double newline each side): Between metadata block and content section. Found with `find()`.
- **Footer separator** (`\n---\n`, single newline each side): Standard PR footer delimiter. Found with `rsplit()`.

These are distinct: `find()` matches the first (content), `rsplit()` matches the last (footer).

## False Match Prevention

The content separator `\n\n---\n\n` can accidentally form when "Remotely executed" notes or other text end with a blank line followed by the footer delimiter `\n---\n`. This creates a false positive for `find()`.

<!-- Source: packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/pr_store/planned_pr_lifecycle.py -->

`find_metadata_block()` defends against this by validating that `<!-- erk:metadata-block:` appears in the prefix. If the marker is absent, the function returns None rather than treating the accidental separator as the real content boundary.

The asymmetric search strategy reinforces this:

- **Content separator**: `find()` — matches the _first_ occurrence (metadata is always at the top)
- **Footer separator**: `rsplit()` — matches the _last_ occurrence (footer is always at the bottom)

This means even if `\n\n---\n\n` appears mid-body, `find()` still finds the real separator first (which has the metadata marker above it), and `rsplit()` still finds the real footer last.

## Constants

**Source:** `PLAN_CONTENT_SEPARATOR`, `DETAILS_OPEN`, `DETAILS_CLOSE` in `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/pr_store/planned_pr_lifecycle.py`

## Self-Referential Close Prevention

Planned PR IS the plan. The `pr_id` from prepare_state is the PR's own number. Using `Closes #N` in the footer would be self-referential, causing the plan to close itself. All three consumers of `assemble_pr_body()` set `issue_number=None` when the backend is `github-draft-pr`.

## Footer Timing Constraint

The PR footer (with checkout command) must be added AFTER `create_pr` returns, because it needs the PR number. `build_plan_stage_body()` intentionally excludes the footer.

## Backward Compatibility

`extract_plan_content()` handles both:

- **Current format**: Content wrapped in `<details><summary>original-plan</summary>` tags (plain text in summary)
- **Old format**: Content wrapped in `<details><summary><code>original-plan</code></summary>` tags (`<code>` tags inside summary — still parsed for compatibility, but no longer written)
- **Legacy flat format**: Content after `PLAN_CONTENT_SEPARATOR` without details tags

The `<code>` tags were removed because Graphite does not render them inside `<summary>` elements (only GitHub does). New writes use plain text in `<summary>`.

## Branch Data Files

Planned PR branches contain `.erk/impl-context/plan.md` and `.erk/impl-context/ref.json`, committed before PR creation to avoid GitHub's "empty branch" rejection. `plan.md` enables inline review comments on the plan via the PR's "Files Changed" tab.

## Lifecycle Stage Tracking

Plans use `lifecycle_stage` tracking. The stage progresses through the values (`planned` → `implementing` → `implemented`) and is stored in the plan-header metadata block within the PR body.

See [Lifecycle Stage Tracking](lifecycle.md#lifecycle-stage-tracking) for the complete stage definitions and write points.

## Type Naming (Historical)

During PR #8679, plan-related types were consolidated to remove "issue-based" naming:

| Old Name                                | New Name                         |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `IssueNextSteps` + `PlannedPRNextSteps` | `PlanNextSteps`                  |
| `IssueNumberEvent`                      | `PlanNumberEvent`                |
| `format_planned_pr_next_steps_plain()`  | `format_plan_next_steps_plain()` |

The new `format_plan_next_steps_plain()` takes only `pr_number` and `url` parameters (no `branch_name`). Historical references to "issue-based" naming in documentation are intentional for migration context.
