# Token Optimization Patterns

When orchestrating agents that each process large documents, naive approaches cause O(n) token bloat in the parent context. This document captures two delegation patterns — and the decision framework for choosing between them — that keep parent context usage constant regardless of input count.

## Core Insight: Content Fetching Is the Token Sink

The parent agent's context is the bottleneck. Every token fetched into parent context persists for the entire conversation. The optimization is always the same: move fetching into child agents so the parent only sees summaries.

## Pattern 1: Parallel Delegation for N-Document Analysis

**When**: Multiple large documents need independent analysis before synthesis (plan consolidation, multi-PR release notes, cross-worktree session aggregation).

**How it works**:

1. Parent validates metadata only (labels, state, issue numbers) — never fetches document bodies
2. Parent launches N child agents **in parallel** (`run_in_background: true`), each responsible for fetching and analyzing its own document
3. Each child returns a compact analysis summary
4. Parent synthesizes from summaries only

**Why this matters**: For N=7 plans at ~5000 tokens each, the naive approach puts ~35,000 tokens in parent context. With delegation, parent context grows by N × summary_size (typically ~8,000 total) — an 82% reduction observed in practice.

The `/erk:replan` command demonstrates this pattern. Step 3 explicitly skips content fetching ("Plan content is fetched by each Explore agent in Step 4, not in the main context"), and Step 4 launches parallel Explore agents that each fetch their own plan as their first action.

<!-- Source: .claude/commands/local/replan-learn-plans.md, Step 3 -->

The `/local:replan-learn-plans` command builds on this by querying all open learn plans and passing the full set to `/erk:replan` for parallel investigation.

### Critical: Wait for All Background Agents

A subtle failure mode: creating the consolidated output before all background agents complete. The parent **must** use `TaskOutput` with `block: true` and adequate timeout before proceeding to synthesis. Incomplete investigation data produces incomplete plans.

## Pattern 2: Single-Agent Delegation for Mechanical Work

**When**: A single multi-step fetch-parse-format pipeline can be fully delegated to one cheap agent.

**How it works**:

1. Parent crafts a structured prompt specifying exact output format
2. Parent launches a single Task agent with `model: "haiku"` (mechanical work doesn't need expensive models)
3. Child fetches, parses, and formats data
4. Parent consumes structured result directly

<!-- Source: .claude/commands/erk/objective-plan.md, Step 2 -->

The `/erk:objective-plan` command demonstrates this pattern with an important model selection nuance. Step 2 delegates objective data fetching (issue metadata, roadmap parsing, status mapping, step recommendation) to a single general-purpose agent. The parent never makes the 3+ sequential fetches itself — it receives a single structured summary.

**Model selection note:** This command uses `sonnet` (not `haiku`) because the work involves multi-step reasoning — status validation, status-to-label mapping, and generating recommendations — not pure mechanical formatting. Use haiku when the child performs only fetch/parse/format; upgrade to sonnet when the child must reason over the data.

<!-- Source: docs/learned/reference/objective-summary-format.md -->

The output contract is specified in `objective-summary-format.md`, which defines the exact sections (OBJECTIVE, STATUS, ROADMAP, PENDING_STEPS, RECOMMENDED) the Task agent must return.

## Decision Framework: Which Pattern to Use

| Condition                                 | Pattern                 | Why                                             |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| N documents, each analyzed independently  | Parallel delegation     | Parallelism + O(1) parent context               |
| Single multi-step fetch-parse pipeline    | Single-agent delegation | Reduces parent turns and token waste            |
| Documents are small (<500 tokens each)    | Fetch in parent         | Delegation overhead exceeds savings             |
| Parent needs full content for synthesis   | Fetch in parent         | Summaries lose necessary detail                 |
| Sequential dependencies between documents | Sequential delegation   | Can't parallelize, but still avoid parent bloat |
| Child agents need to communicate          | Rethink architecture    | Agent-to-agent communication isn't supported    |

## Model Selection for Delegated Work

| Work type                          | Model            | Rationale                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Fetch, parse, format (mechanical)  | haiku            | Sufficient capability, lowest cost    |
| Codebase investigation, analysis   | Default (sonnet) | Needs reasoning for status assessment |
| Plan synthesis, creative decisions | Parent agent     | Highest-quality reasoning required    |

### When to Upgrade from Haiku to Sonnet

| Criterion                              | Model  | Example                                                |
| -------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Pure data fetching and formatting      | haiku  | Fetch issue body, extract YAML, return structured JSON |
| Status validation or enum mapping      | sonnet | Map lifecycle stages to display labels                 |
| Multi-step reasoning over fetched data | sonnet | Parse roadmap, assess status, generate recommendations |
| Conditional logic based on data shape  | sonnet | Choose different output format based on plan type      |

**Anti-pattern**: Using opus or sonnet for pure data fetching and formatting where haiku suffices.

## Anti-Patterns

**Fetching "just to inspect"**: Parent fetches a document to decide whether it needs analysis, then delegates the analysis. The inspection itself wastes tokens — delegate the fetch-and-decide as a unit.

**Summarizing summaries**: Launching a child agent to summarize another child agent's summary. If the first summary is too large, fix the first agent's output contract, don't add layers.

**Skipping the output contract**: Delegating without specifying the return format. The child agent returns verbose, unstructured output that consumes as many parent tokens as the raw content would have.
