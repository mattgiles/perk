# One-Shot Workflow

The one-shot workflow enables fully autonomous planning and implementation from a single CLI command. It dispatches a GitHub Actions workflow that creates a plan and implements it without human intervention.

## End-to-End Pipeline

```
CLI dispatch → branch + draft PR → workflow trigger
  → Claude planning → plan saved to PR → implementation → PR ready
```

### Entry Points

Two CLI commands trigger the pipeline:

- `erk one-shot <prompt>` -- direct dispatch (model shortcuts: `haiku`/`h`, `sonnet`/`s`, `opus`/`o`)
- `erk objective plan <issue> --one-shot [--node <id>]` -- objective-driven dispatch

Both converge on `dispatch_one_shot_remote()` in `src/erk/cli/commands/one_shot_remote_dispatch.py`.

**Key constraint:** Planning and implementation run in separate Claude sessions. No context carries over. The plan must be self-contained and explicit.

## Backend-Conditional Dispatch

The dispatch behavior depends on the active plan backend:

### PlannedPRBackend (default)

The draft PR **is** the plan entity. No skeleton issue is created:

1. `generate_planned_pr_branch_name()` creates a `plnd/` branch name
2. Branch is created, pushed, and draft PR opened with `plan-header` metadata
3. `plan_issue_number` is set to the PR number (the PR is the plan)
4. Workflow fills in the actual plan content later

**Branch naming:** `plnd/{slug}-{MM-DD-HHMM}` (e.g., `plnd/my-task-01-15-1430`)

The slug is truncated to stay under git's 31-character worktree limit.

## Objective Integration

When dispatched via `erk objective plan --one-shot`, the objective plan command:

1. Validates the objective exists
2. Builds a prompt string including step ID and phase name for context
3. Passes `objective_issue` and `node_id` as `extra_workflow_inputs` in `OneShotDispatchParams`
4. These become `OBJECTIVE_ISSUE` and `NODE_ID` environment variables in the workflow

## GitHub Actions Workflow

The `.github/workflows/one-shot.yml` workflow has two jobs:

### Plan Job

1. Validates secrets (ERK_QUEUE_GH_PAT)
2. Checks out the branch and sets up tools
3. Writes prompt to `.erk/impl-context/prompt.md`
4. Runs `@.claude/commands/erk/system/one-shot-plan.md` Claude command with environment variables:
   - `WORKFLOW_RUN_URL` -- current workflow run URL
   - `OBJECTIVE_ISSUE` -- objective issue number (if from roadmap)
   - `NODE_ID` -- specific roadmap node ID
   - `PLAN_ISSUE_NUMBER` -- plan entity number (PR number for planned-PR backend)
5. Validates Claude produced `.erk/impl-context/plan.md` and `.erk/impl-context/plan-result.json` (with `pr_number` in JSON)
6. Runs `erk exec register-one-shot-pr` for metadata registration
7. Optionally updates objective roadmap step

### Implement Job

Reuses `.github/workflows/plan-implement.yml` -- the same workflow used for manual plan submissions. Triggered only if the plan job produced an issue number.

**Concurrency control:**

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: one-shot-${{ inputs.branch_name }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

## Registration Step (Best-Effort Composition)

`src/erk/cli/commands/exec/scripts/register_one_shot_pr.py` performs four independent operations that `erk pr submit` normally handles at submit time. Each operation is best-effort -- failures are logged but don't block others:

1. **Dispatch metadata** -- the primary metadata source is the CLI dispatch (`write_dispatch_metadata()` in `src/erk/cli/commands/pr/metadata_helpers.py`), with CI registration as a fallback. Writes `run_id`, `node_id`, `dispatched_at` to the plan entity's `plan-header` metadata block.
2. **Queued comment** -- adds a "Queued for Implementation" emoji comment to the plan with PR link and workflow run URL
3. **Lifecycle stage** -- updates the plan entity's lifecycle stage to "planned"

The command outputs JSON results for each operation with success/error details.

### Dispatch Metadata Two-Phase Write

Dispatch metadata is written in two phases:

1. **At dispatch time** (CLI): `write_dispatch_metadata()` writes `dispatched_at`, `run_id`, `node_id` immediately after workflow trigger
2. **At registration time** (CI): `register_one_shot_pr.py` writes any remaining fields that weren't available at dispatch time

The CLI write is the primary source; CI registration fills gaps when the CLI couldn't complete (e.g., network failure during dispatch).

### Divergence Risk: One-Shot vs PR Dispatch

One-shot dispatch and `erk pr submit` both push branches and create PRs, but one-shot uses force-push (squash) while plan-submit may use regular push. After a one-shot dispatch, the local branch may diverge from remote. Always `git pull --rebase` before making local changes to a one-shot branch.

## Claude Planning Command

`.claude/commands/erk/system/one-shot-plan.md` defines what Claude does during the plan job:

1. Reads prompt from `.erk/impl-context/prompt.md`
2. Fetches objective context if `$OBJECTIVE_ISSUE` is set
3. Explores codebase following documentation-first discovery
4. Writes a comprehensive, self-contained plan to `.erk/impl-context/plan.md`
5. Saves plan to GitHub issue:
   - If `$PLAN_ISSUE_NUMBER` is set: updates the pre-created entity
   - Otherwise: creates a new issue (backward compatible)
6. Writes `plan-result.json` with `issue_number` and `title`

## Dry-Run Mode

`dispatch_one_shot()` supports `--dry-run` which shows what would happen without side effects. Dry-run mode must NOT create skeleton issues or branches.

## Branch Safety

The dispatch function commits directly to the target branch using git plumbing (`commit_files_to_branch`) without checking out any branch. The user's working tree and HEAD remain untouched throughout the dispatch.

## Slug Generation

<!-- Source: src/erk/cli/commands/one_shot_remote_dispatch.py, dispatch_one_shot_remote(); src/erk/cli/commands/objective/plan_cmd.py, plan_objective() -->

Branch slugs for one-shot branches are generated by calling `ctx.llm_caller.call()` directly with `BRANCH_SLUG_SYSTEM_PROMPT` (defined in `src/erk/core/branch_slug_generator.py`). The prompt instructs the LLM to produce 2-4 hyphenated lowercase words (max 30 characters) that capture the essence of the task.

### Generation Flow

1. The dispatch function calls `ctx.llm_caller.call()` directly with `BRANCH_SLUG_SYSTEM_PROMPT`
2. The raw response is postprocessed: whitespace, quotes, and backticks are stripped, then the slug passes through `sanitize_worktree_name()` for character validation
3. The validated slug is used to construct the branch name

### Fallback Behavior

When the API key is missing or the LLM call fails, the dispatch code falls back to `sanitize_worktree_name()` applied to the raw prompt text. This produces a functional but less descriptive slug.

### Call Sites

- `dispatch_one_shot_remote()` in `src/erk/cli/commands/one_shot_remote_dispatch.py` — one-shot dispatch
- `plan_objective()` in `src/erk/cli/commands/objective/plan_cmd.py` — objective plan dispatch

## Prompt Validation and Rejection

The one-shot planning command includes a Step 1.5 validation gate that rejects invalid or unactionable prompts before planning begins.

### What Makes a Prompt Invalid

After exploring the codebase, if the planning agent cannot produce an actionable implementation plan (e.g., the prompt is too vague, asks for something impossible, or contradicts the codebase), it rejects the prompt instead of producing a bad plan.

### Rejection Output Format

The agent writes a rejection to `.erk/impl-context/plan-result.json`:

```json
{
  "rejected": true,
  "reason": "The prompt asks for X but the codebase already has Y"
}
```

Normal (non-rejected) output:

```json
{ "pr_number": 1234, "title": "Plan title" }
```

### Workflow Routing on Rejection

In `.github/workflows/one-shot.yml`, after the plan job completes:

1. The workflow checks `plan-result.json` for the `rejected` field
2. If `rejected: true`, it extracts the `reason` and logs a GitHub Actions warning
3. If a `plan_issue_number` was provided, the workflow closes the plan issue with a comment: `"Plan rejected by planning agent: <reason>"`
4. The implement job is skipped entirely (not triggered)

### Source of Truth

- **Validation logic**: `.claude/commands/erk/system/one-shot-plan.md` (Step 1.5)
- **Rejection routing**: `.github/workflows/one-shot.yml` (rejection detection step)
