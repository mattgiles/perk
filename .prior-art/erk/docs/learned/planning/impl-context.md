# Impl-Context Staging Directory

`.erk/impl-context/` is a temporary staging directory used during draft-PR plan saving. It exists on the plan branch between plan creation and the start of implementation, then gets cleaned up.

## Lifecycle

### Creation

During `plan_save.py`, after creating the plan branch, the script:

1. Checks out the plan branch
2. Creates `.erk/impl-context/` and writes `plan.md` (plan content) and `ref.json` (plan reference metadata)
3. Stages and commits both files
4. Pushes to remote
5. Checks out the original branch

This commit gives the draft PR a non-empty diff (GitHub rejects PRs with no file changes) and enables inline plan review via the "Files Changed" tab.

See `_commit_impl_context_files()` in `src/erk/cli/commands/exec/scripts/plan_save.py`.

### Cleanup

The directory is cleaned up before implementation begins via a two-phase deferred cleanup pattern. All five setup paths converge at **Step 2d** in `plan-implement.md`, which is the single cleanup point:

1. **`setup_impl_from_pr.py`** (Phase 1, read-only) — Reads `plan.md` and `ref.json`, copies content into `.erk/impl-context/`, but deliberately does NOT delete the directory. Deletion is handled by plan-implement.md Step 2d via git rm + commit + push.

2. **`plan-implement.md` Step 2d** (Phase 2, git cleanup — convergence point) — All five setup paths (ISSUE_ARG, FILE_ARG, existing `.erk/impl-context/` with issue tracking, existing `.erk/impl-context/` without issue tracking, fallback plan-save) reach this step. Performs the actual deletion with `git rm -rf .erk/impl-context/ && git commit && git push`. This deferred approach ensures removal is committed, not just deleted from the local filesystem. The step is **idempotent** — safe to run even when the directory doesn't exist.

3. **`plan-implement.yml` CI workflow** — Cleans up before the implementation agent runs, as a safety net for remote execution.

### Why It Could Leak (Historical)

Prior to PR #7747 (#7752), cleanup was not guaranteed across all setup paths — if a path bypassed Step 2d, the files would persist on the branch and appear in the final PR diff. This has been fixed: all paths now converge at Step 2d.

The key failure mode was confusing "delete from disk" (shutil.rmtree) with "remove from git tracking" (git rm + commit + push). When adding a new setup path, always route through the Step 2d convergence point — skipping it silently bypasses cleanup.

## Prevention Strategies

### Impl-Context Cleanup

Both submit paths use the LBYL pattern to clean up stale `.erk/impl-context/` before creating a new one:

<!-- Source: packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/impl_context.py, impl_context_exists -->

See the `impl_context_exists()` / `remove_impl_context()` LBYL guard in `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/impl_context.py`. Both submit paths (submit pipeline and dispatch) use this pattern to prevent errors from a prior failed submission leaving a stale `.erk/impl-context/` directory behind (fixed in PR #7687).

### Deferred Impl-Context Deletion

`setup_impl_from_pr.py` reads the impl-context files but deliberately does NOT delete them. The comment is explicit:

> "Do not delete here — Step 2d in plan-implement.md handles git rm + commit + push"

This deferred pattern exists because filesystem deletion (`shutil.rmtree`) only removes the local copy. The files remain in git tracking and appear in the PR diff. Only `git rm` + commit + push removes them from the branch history.

## Cleanup at End of plan-implement

In addition to the pre-implementation cleanup (Step 2d), the plan-implement workflow also performs end-of-implementation cleanup via **Step 11**, which calls `erk exec cleanup-impl-context`. This exec script (`src/erk/cli/commands/exec/scripts/cleanup_impl_context.py`) removes any `.erk/impl-context/` that may have been recreated during implementation. It is idempotent: if the directory doesn't exist, it reports `not_found` and exits 0.

## The plnd/ Skip Saga

<!-- Source: src/erk/cli/commands/pr/submit_pipeline.py, cleanup_impl_for_submit -->

The `cleanup_impl_for_submit()` function in `src/erk/cli/commands/pr/submit_pipeline.py` runs for ALL branches including `plnd/*` — there is no special casing.

Historical context: A `plnd/` skip was added (PR #8650) to `cleanup_impl_for_submit()` based on the assumption that plan PRs needed their `.erk/impl-context/` preserved. This was incorrect and was removed (PR #8669) because plan-save uses `push_to_remote()` directly and never goes through the submit pipeline. The skip was never actually triggered in practice.

**Key insight**: `plan-save` never goes through the submit pipeline — it pushes directly via `git.remote.push_to_remote()`.
