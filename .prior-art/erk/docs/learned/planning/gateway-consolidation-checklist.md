    warning: "Source files that don't follow standard naming (e.g., executor.py instead of abc.py) must be renamed to abc.py/real.py/fake.py during the move. The gateway directory convention requires standard file names."

# Gateway Consolidation Checklist

## Context

All gateway packages live under `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/`. This was not always the case — gateways were originally scattered across domain-specific directories (e.g., TUI commands, CLI utilities). Consolidation into a single `gateway/` tree was done because:

1. **Discoverability** — agents searching for "where is the X gateway?" need one place to look, not a codebase-wide search
2. **Consistency enforcement** — the 4-file pattern (abc/real/fake/dry_run) is easier to verify when all gateways are siblings
3. **Import predictability** — `erk_shared.gateway.<name>.abc` is a mechanical derivation from the gateway name, eliminating guesswork

There are currently 27 gateway packages in this directory. Some use the full 4-file pattern, others use a simplified 3-file pattern (no dry_run). Complex domains (Git, GitHub, Graphite) use nested sub-gateways.

## Operation Ordering: Why It Matters

The single most important insight from past consolidation work: **move all files before updating any imports**.

| Phase             | What                                           | Why                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Move files     | `git mv` all sources to new locations          | Preserves git history; creates a codebase that won't compile but has correct file layout |
| 2. Update imports | LibCST batch transformation                    | All old→new path mappings are known; systematic replacement prevents missed call sites   |
| 3. Lint fix       | `ruff check --fix` across affected directories | Import sorting violations (I001) are inevitable after bulk moves; fix once at the end    |
| 4. Test           | Full test suite                                | Catches any missed import sites or broken circular dependencies                          |

**Anti-pattern: interleaving moves and import updates.** Moving gateway A, fixing its imports, then moving gateway B creates intermediate broken states where gateway A's imports reference the new location but gateway B's cross-references still point to the old one. Batch all moves first, then batch all import updates.

## Non-Obvious Pitfalls

### File Naming Normalization

Scattered gateways often have domain-specific file names (e.g., `executor.py` for the ABC, `real_executor.py` for the real implementation). During the move, these must be renamed to the standard `abc.py`/`real.py`/`fake.py` convention. This is a rename-during-move — `git mv old_path/executor.py new_path/abc.py` handles both operations atomically.

### Circular Imports After Consolidation

Moving gateways into sibling directories can surface circular imports that were previously hidden by package boundaries. The symptom is `ImportError: cannot import name 'X' from partially initialized module`.

The root cause is usually a gateway ABC that imports types from another gateway. The fix is a `TYPE_CHECKING` guard — these imports are only needed for type annotations, not runtime behavior. This is one of the few places where erk uses `TYPE_CHECKING` (normally erk avoids it because LBYL patterns need runtime types).

### Empty `__init__.py` with Docstring

Per erk's no-re-exports convention, `__init__.py` files must be empty of executable code. But they should include a docstring listing the submodules and their key symbols. This acts as a human-readable index without creating import shortcuts that hide the canonical import path.

## Batch vs Single-Gateway Consolidation

| Approach                      | When to use                        | Trade-off                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single gateway**            | Gateway has few import sites (<10) | Simpler PR, easier review, but overhead per gateway is high                                               |
| **Batch (multiple gateways)** | Consolidating 3+ related gateways  | One LibCST pass handles all remappings; one lint fix; one test run. But PR is larger and harder to review |

For batch operations, LibCST is nearly mandatory — manual import updates across dozens of files are error-prone and slow.

## Post-Move Checklist

After moving files and updating imports, these steps are easy to forget:

1. **Update gateway inventory** — add the new entry to the gateway inventory doc
2. **Update any doc referencing old paths** — grep `docs/learned/` for the old import path
3. **Verify the `__init__.py`** exists in the new directory — missing it produces `ModuleNotFoundError` that looks like a bad import rather than a missing file
