# Remote Implementation Idempotency

Remote implementation must handle worktree reuse safely.

## The Bug (Fixed)

When remote implementation reused an existing worktree:

1. Old branch still existed
2. Code created a NEW branch anyway (e.g., `P77-fix-...-01-25-0611`)
3. Old PR became orphaned (pointed to `P77-fix-...-01-24-2229` with no commits)
4. CI failures on the orphan PR

## The Fix

Before creating a branch, check if the worktree already has one matching the issue:

- **If branch exists and matches plan**: Use it, skip branch creation entirely
- **If branch exists but differs**: Error clearly (don't silently orphan)
- **Only create new branch**: If no matching branch exists

## Detection Pattern

Check if current branch name matches the expected prefix:

```
P{issue_number}-*
```

If already on a matching branch, output the existing branch name and continue with `.erk/impl-context/` setup.

## User Experience

**Before (buggy):**

```bash
# Remote workflow re-runs with --issue argument
erk exec setup-impl-from-pr 77
# Creates new branch P77-fix-...-01-25-0611
# Orphans existing P77-fix-...-01-24-2229, PR now broken
```

**After (fixed):**

```bash
# Remote workflow re-runs with --issue argument
erk exec setup-impl-from-pr 77
# Output: Already on branch for issue #77: P77-fix-remote-implementation-01-24-2229
# Continues using existing branch, PR preserved
```
