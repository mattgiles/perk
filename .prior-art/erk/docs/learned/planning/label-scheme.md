# PR and Plan Label Assignment Scheme

Erk uses just **2 labels** for PR classification: `erk-pr` (all erk PRs) and `erk-learn` (learn plans).
Plans are identified by the `[erk-pr]` or `[erk-learn]` title prefix.

## Label Taxonomy

| Label           | Purpose                          | Applied To                           |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `erk-pr`        | Base label — all erk PRs         | All plans, learn plans, and code PRs |
| `erk-learn`     | Type label — documentation plans | Learn plans                          |
| `erk-objective` | Separate system — objectives     | Objective issues                     |

Plans are identified by the `[erk-pr]` or `[erk-learn]` title prefix (applied via `get_title_tag_from_labels()`).

## Label Assignment

**Plan PRs** (via `PlannedPRBackend.create_plan()`):

1. Applies `erk-pr` (base label for all erk-submitted PRs)
2. Applies `erk-learn` for learn plans
3. Title is prefixed with `[erk-pr]` or `[erk-learn]` for identification

**Code PRs** (via `erk pr submit` for non-plan branches):

1. The submit pipeline's `label_code_pr` step applies `erk-pr`
2. No title prefix is added (code PRs are not plans)

## Querying by Label

| View             | Query Label     | Exclude Label | Shows             |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| PRs (dash tab 1) | `erk-pr`        | `erk-learn`   | All non-learn PRs |
| Learn            | `erk-learn`     | (none)        | Learn plans only  |
| Objectives       | `erk-objective` | (none)        | Objectives only   |

For plan-only filtering within `erk-pr` results, use client-side `[erk-pr]` title prefix check.

## Server-Side Filtering

The PRs view queries `erk-pr` with `exclude_labels=("erk-learn",)` to show only non-learn PRs.
This server-side exclusion prevents learn PRs from appearing in the main plans tab.

## Label Backfill Side Effects

Adding labels to existing issues changes GitHub's `updated_at` timestamp. This affects:

- Sort order in plan list views (most recently updated first)
- TUI data table ordering
- Any time-based filtering
