# Cross-Artifact Analysis

This document describes how erk commands analyze relationships between different GitHub artifacts (PRs, plans, branches, issues).

## PR-Plan Relationships

Plans and PRs can have complex relationships:

| Relationship | Description                                 | Detection Method                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Linked       | PR explicitly references plan               | PR body contains `Plan: #<number>` reference |
| Superseding  | PR implements work that makes plan obsolete | Compare PR changes with plan intent          |
| Partial      | PR implements subset of plan scope          | Evidence-based analysis of overlap           |
| Independent  | PR and plan address unrelated concerns      | No meaningful overlap in changes             |

## Evidence-Based Analysis Pattern

The `/local:check-superceded` command implements a structured approach to cross-artifact analysis:

1. **Parse input** - Extract PR number to analyze
2. **Gather context** - Retrieve PR metadata, diff, and changed files
3. **Understand intent** - Extract what changes the PR introduces
4. **Search for evidence** - Check master branch for matching implementations
5. **Create evidence table** - Document findings with specific file/function matches
6. **Determine verdict** - Apply classification thresholds

This pattern can be adapted for future commands that need to assess relationships between artifacts.
