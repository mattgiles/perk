# Command Optimization Patterns

Patterns for reducing command file size and context consumption through modularization.

## Why Command Size Matters

Since Claude Code 2.1.0, commands and skills are equivalent - both are loaded when invoked. Command text in `.claude/commands/` behaves identically to skills in `.claude/skills/`.

| Content Type        | When Loaded                           | Optimization Impact                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Command/skill text  | When invoked (unless cached)          | High - reduce aggressively          |
| `@` referenced docs | Once per session (cached after first) | Medium - extract reference material |

## The @ Reference Pattern

### Syntax

Place an `@` reference on its own line to include external documentation:

```markdown
### Step 4: Execute phases

@docs/execution-guide.md

For each phase, follow the guide above.
```

### How It Works

1. Claude Code expands `@path/to/doc.md` to the file contents
2. Expansion happens once per session (cached)
3. Multiple references to same doc don't duplicate content

### Valid Locations

| Location          | Example                                 | Notes                  |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `.claude/skills/` | `@.claude/skills/ci-iteration/SKILL.md` | Project-specific skill |
| Relative path     | `@../shared/common.md`                  | From command location  |

## When to Extract

### Good Candidates for Extraction

| Content Type               | Example                         | Why Extract                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Reference tables           | Coding standards, error codes   | Loaded once, referenced many times |
| Detailed step instructions | Multi-step workflows            | Changes rarely, bulky inline       |
| Shared content             | Common patterns across commands | Single source of truth             |
| Examples                   | Sample code, templates          | Reference material                 |

### Keep Inline

| Content Type            | Example                       | Why Keep                         |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Critical decision logic | "If X then do Y"              | Must be visible every invocation |
| Short unique content    | Command-specific instructions | Overhead of separate file        |
| Frequently changing     | Active development            | Easier to maintain inline        |

## Size Targets

| Artifact Type  | Target Size  | Maximum      |
| -------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Commands       | <5,000 chars | 8,000 chars  |
| Skills (core)  | <3,000 chars | 5,000 chars  |
| Skills (total) | <8,000 chars | 12,000 chars |
| External docs  | No limit     | Keep focused |

## Anti-Patterns

### Extracting Critical Logic

```markdown
# DON'T: Extract decision points

@docs/when-to-stop.md # User won't see this every time!

# DO: Keep inline

**When to Stop:**

- All checks pass → SUCCESS
- Same error 3x → STUCK
- 10 iterations → STUCK
```

### Too Many Small Docs

```markdown
# DON'T: Fragment excessively

@docs/step1.md
@docs/step2.md
@docs/step3.md
@docs/step4.md

# DO: Group related content

@docs/execution-workflow.md
```

## LLM-Intelligent Parameter Pattern

For user-facing parameters that accept flexible input (dates, ranges, etc.), prefer LLM interpretation over rigid format matching:

**Before (format-matching):**

```python
# Rigid: requires exact format, fails on "last month" or "since January"
click.option("--since", type=click.DateTime(formats=["%Y-%m-%d"]))
```

**After (LLM-interpreted):**

```python
# Flexible: LLM parses natural language into structured query
# "last 30 days", "since January", "2026-02-01" all work
```

**Example:** The `code-stats` command upgraded date parsing from a fixed format list to flexible natural language interpretation, using Sonnet (upgraded from Haiku) for accuracy. Rolling defaults (e.g., "last 30 days") are preferred over fixed dates because they stay useful without manual updates.

**Trade-off:** LLM interpretation adds latency and cost per invocation. Only use for user-facing parameters where flexibility matters. Internal APIs should use typed parameters.
