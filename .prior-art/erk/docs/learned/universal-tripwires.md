# Universal Tripwires

These critical rules apply across **all** code areas in erk. They are the most important tripwires that every agent should be aware of before writing any code.

Unlike category-specific tripwires (which are loaded when working in specific directories), universal tripwires should always be consulted.

Each tripwire links to detailed documentation:
