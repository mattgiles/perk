# Learn Plan Land Flow

When landing a PR from a learn plan branch, the land execution pipeline runs additional steps that update the parent plan's metadata. This document explains **why** learn plans need special handling and how the pipeline orchestrates these post-merge operations.

## Why Learn Plans Need Special Pipeline Steps

**The core problem**: Learn plans document insights from implementation sessions. The parent plan (the feature that was implemented) needs to track when its documentation has landed.

**Without special handling**, these metadata updates would be manual:

- Engineers would manually update parent issue status after landing docs
- No visibility into which plans have completed their learning cycle

**The solution**: The execution pipeline detects learn plan branches and runs additional steps after merge:

1. **Update parent plan metadata**: Set `learn_status = plan_completed` and record the PR number

## How Learn Plan Detection Works

<!-- Source: src/erk/cli/commands/land_pipeline.py, check_learn_status() step -->

The validation pipeline's `check_learn_status()` step extracts the issue number from the branch name prefix. If a plan exists for that number, it triggers downstream execution steps. See `check_learn_status()` in `src/erk/cli/commands/land_pipeline.py`.

**Why extract from branch name instead of PR labels?**

Branch names are stable identifiers (set at `erk br co --for-pr` time). PR labels can be added/removed during review. Extracting from branch name means learn plan detection is deterministic—the same branch will always trigger the same pipeline steps.

**Detection sequence**:

1. Read `plan-ref.json` from `.erk/impl-context/` to get plan ID
2. Check if the corresponding issue exists
3. Optionally prompt user to trigger async learn (if not already learned)
4. Populate `state.plan_id` for execution pipeline

## Execution Pipeline Steps for Learn Plans

<!-- Source: src/erk/cli/commands/land_pipeline.py, _execution_pipeline() -->

After the PR merges, the execution pipeline runs learn-specific steps in this order. See `_execution_pipeline()` in `src/erk/cli/commands/land_pipeline.py`.

**Why this ordering?**

1. **`merge_pr`** (standard) — Merge first; if this fails, no cleanup needed
2. **`update_learn_plan`** — Update parent plan's `learn_status` field
3. **`cleanup_and_navigate`** (standard) — Delete branches and navigate

**Why learn plan updates come early**: If execution fails partway through, we prefer to have updated the learn metadata rather than leaving it stale.

## Parent Plan Metadata Update

<!-- Source: src/erk/cli/commands/land_pipeline.py, update_learn_plan() step -->

The `update_learn_plan()` step reads the `learned_from_issue` field from the current plan and updates that parent plan's issue body. See `update_learn_plan()` in `src/erk/cli/commands/land_pipeline.py`.

**Why update a different issue's body?**

Learn plans are child plans (they document parent features). The parent plan is the canonical place to track learning status. Updating the parent creates a bidirectional link:

- Parent → Learn: `learn_plan_pr: 456` (PR that implemented the docs)
- Learn → Parent: `learned_from_issue: 123` (feature that was documented)

**Fail-open pattern**: If the parent issue doesn't exist or the `learned_from_issue` field is missing, the step silently returns. This prevents land failures when metadata is malformed or deleted.

**Critical fields updated**:

```yaml
# In parent plan body
learn_status: plan_completed # Was: completed_with_plan
learn_plan_pr: 456 # The landed PR number
```

## State Field Threading

<!-- Source: src/erk/cli/commands/land_pipeline.py, LandState dataclass -->

The `LandState` dataclass threads `plan_id` through the validation and execution pipelines. See the `LandState` definition in `src/erk/cli/commands/land_pipeline.py`.

**Why thread through state instead of re-computing in each step?**

Validation extracts the issue number once and validates it exists. Execution steps assume validation passed and use the cached issue number. This avoids redundant GitHub API calls and ensures all steps operate on the same issue.

**Population lifecycle**:

1. **Validation pipeline**: `check_learn_status()` extracts from branch name → `state.plan_id`
2. **Shell script boundary**: Issue number serialized as flag (if available)
3. **Execution pipeline**: `make_execution_state()` re-derives from branch name → `state.plan_id`

**Why re-derive during execution?**

The shell script boundary is minimal (PR number, branch name, basic flags). Re-deriving the issue number from the branch name ensures execution state matches current branch state, even if the branch was modified between validation and execution.

## When Learn Plan Steps Are Skipped

All learn-specific steps check `state.plan_id` and skip execution if `None`. This happens when:

- Branch name doesn't have an issue prefix (e.g., `feature-branch` not `P123-feature-branch`)
- Issue doesn't exist on GitHub (deleted or never created)
- Execution was invoked manually without a plan context

**Why fail-open instead of fail-closed?**

Not every branch is a plan branch. Regular feature branches should land normally without triggering learn plan logic. Checking `plan_id is None` makes the pipeline generic—it handles both plan and non-plan branches.

## Note on Objective Updates

Objective updates are handled separately outside the execution pipeline (via the TUI's `_on_land_success` callback), not as a pipeline step. The execution pipeline focuses on learn plan metadata and review PR cleanup.

## Menu Option: Trigger Async Learn

The 4th menu option in the land flow allows manually triggering `erk learn` for PRs that haven't been learned yet. This was added in PR #6956 to support the async learn workflow where learning happens after landing.
