# Cli Tripwires

Rules triggered by matching actions in code.

**Design batch commands that process items despite validation failures** → Read [Batch Exec Commands](batch-exec-commands.md) first. Validate ALL items upfront before processing ANY items. Stop on first validation error.

**Return non-zero exit codes for batch command failures** → Read [Batch Exec Commands](batch-exec-commands.md) first. Always exit 0, encode errors in JSON output with per-item success fields.

**Use OR semantics for batch success (success=true if any item succeeds)** → Read [Batch Exec Commands](batch-exec-commands.md) first. Use AND semantics: top-level success=true only if ALL items succeed.

**Using RuntimeError for expected CLI failures** → Read [CLI Error Handling Anti-Patterns](error-handling-antipatterns.md) first. RuntimeError signals a programmer error (bug in the code), NOT expected user-facing failures. Use UserFacingCliError for expected conditions (missing files, invalid input, precondition violations) that should exit cleanly with an actionable message.

**WORKFLOW_COMMAND_MAP maps command names to .yml filenames** → Read [Workflow Commands](workflow-commands.md) first. command names intentionally diverge from filenames (e.g., pr-rebase → pr-rebase.yml, but plan-implement → plan-implement.yml via DISPATCH_WORKFLOW_NAME constant)

**adding --from-current-branch without handling detached HEAD** → Read [Slot Assign --from-current-branch](slot-assign-from-current-branch.md) first. When the target branch is checked out in another worktree, fall back to detached HEAD checkout. See slot-assign-from-current-branch.md.

**adding --json flag to a command without using @json_output decorator** → Read [Agent-Friendly CLI Design Principles](agent-friendly-cli.md) first. Use the shared @json_output decorator from src/erk/cli/json_output.py. Do not manually implement JSON serialization in individual commands.

**adding --json flag to a human command** → Read [Adding Machine JSON Commands](adding-json-to-commands.md) first. Machine JSON output belongs in the `erk json` command tree. Create a machine adapter as json_cli.py in the command's subpackage instead.

**adding --json flag to a human-facing command** → Read [Machine Command Architecture](json-command-decorator.md) first. Machine JSON output lives in the `erk json` command tree, not as a flag on human commands. Create a json_cli.py machine adapter in the command's subpackage.

**adding --sync to checkout** → Read [Checkout/Teleport Command Split](checkout-teleport-split.md) first. checkout is local-only; use teleport for sync. Checkout preserves local state; teleport force-resets to remote.

**adding a column to plan list without checking PlanDataTable.\_setup_columns()** → Read [Plan List Provider Pattern](plan-list-provider-pattern.md) first. Column order in list_cmd.py must mirror plan_table.py for consistency between CLI and TUI. Check both files when modifying columns.

**adding a new exec script that produces JSON consumed by another exec script** → Read [Exec Script Schema Patterns](exec-script-schema-patterns.md) first. Define shared TypedDict in packages/erk-shared/ for type-safe schema. Both producer and consumer import from the same schema definition.

**adding a new required gitignore entry** → Read [Upgrade Workflow](upgrade-workflow.md) first. Add to REQUIRED_GITIGNORE_ENTRIES in src/erk/core/init_utils.py:8. The upgrade path in init/main.py automatically syncs these entries.

**adding a new secret type without updating \_SecretConfig pattern** → Read [OAuth Secret Management](oauth-secret-management.md) first. Use the \_SecretConfig frozen dataclass pattern for parameterized secret behavior. See admin.py for the existing pattern.

**adding a new step to the submit pipeline** → Read [PR Submit Pipeline Architecture](pr-submit-pipeline.md) first. Each step must return SubmitState | SubmitError. Use dataclasses.replace() for state updates. Add the step to \_submit_pipeline() tuple.

**adding a parameter to erk exec without updating calling command** → Read [Parameter Addition Checklist](parameter-addition-checklist.md) first. 5-step verification required. Parameter additions must thread through skill argument-hint, command invocations, AND exec script. Miss any layer and you get silent failures or discovery problems. See parameter-addition-checklist.md.

**adding bulleted lists to CLI command help text** → Read [Click Help Text Formatting](help-text-formatting.md) first. Place  before bulleted/numbered lists to prevent Click from merging items into single line.

**adding click.echo() without sys.stdout.flush() in pipeline commands** → Read [Piped Output Flushing Pattern](piped-output-flushing.md) first. Python buffers stdout when piped. Without explicit flush, users see no output until command completes or buffer fills.

**adding discovery logic outside prepare_state()** → Read [PR Submit Pipeline Architecture](pr-submit-pipeline.md) first. All discovery (branch name, plan number, parent branch, etc.) must happen in prepare_state() to prevent duplication. Later steps assume these fields are populated.

**adding doctor subcommand without invoke_without_command=True** → Read [Doctor Workflow Subcommand](doctor-workflow.md) first. Doctor uses Click group with invoke_without_command=True so bare 'erk doctor' preserves original behavior.

**adding inline shell logic to a slash command instead of using erk exec** → Read [Slash Command to Exec Migration](slash-command-exec-migration.md) first. Extract reusable logic to an erk exec command. Slash commands should orchestrate exec calls, not contain business logic.

**adding new CLI flags without validation** → Read [CLI Options Validation](cli-options-validation.md) first. Check if validation logic is needed when adding new flags. Boolean flags rarely need validation, but flags accepting values (paths, names, numbers) should validate constraints.

**adding new exec script parameters with 'issue' in the name** → Read [erk exec Commands](erk-exec-commands.md) first. When adding new exec script parameters, use 'plan' terminology not 'issue'. See erk-exec-commands.md Phase 5 Terminology Standardization.

**adding or modifying CLI commands without regenerating reference docs** → Read [Auto-Generated Reference Documentation](auto-generated-reference-docs.md) first. After CLI changes, run 'erk-dev gen-exec-reference-docs' to update auto-generated exec reference documentation. Stale docs confuse users and agents.

**adding sequential yes/no prompts for a single decision** → Read [Prompt Consolidation Pattern](prompt-consolidation-pattern.md) first. Consolidate into one binary choice. Multiple prompts for the same decision create unnecessary cognitive load. See the branch reuse example.

**adding session discovery code before checking for preprocessed materials** → Read [Learn Command Conditional Pipeline](learn-command-conditional-pipeline.md) first. Check learn branch first to avoid misleading output. The learn command checks \_get_learn_materials_branch() BEFORE session discovery. If a learn branch exists, all session discovery is skipped.

**adding user-interactive steps (confirmations, prompts) without CI detection** → Read [CI-Aware Commands](ci-aware-commands.md) first. Commands with user interaction must check `in_github_actions()` and skip prompts in CI. Interactive prompts hang indefinitely in GitHub Actions workflows.

**applying @machine_command below @click.command in the decorator stack** → Read [Machine Command Architecture](json-command-decorator.md) first. @machine_command must be applied ABOVE @click.command. The correct order is @mcp_exposed > @machine_command > @click.command.

**assuming erk implement always requires a plan number argument** → Read [Implement Command](implement-command.md) first. erk implement supports auto-detection from .erk/impl-context/ and from branch PRs. Read this doc first.

**building CLI tables with Rich** → Read [Rich Table CLI Output Pattern](rich-table-output.md) first. Use Console(stderr=True, force_terminal=True) to avoid breaking piped output. Use escape() on user-provided text. See rich-table-output.md for the full pattern.

**calling an external tool that overwrites state without capturing it first** → Read [PR Submit Pipeline Architecture](pr-submit-pipeline.md) first. Save state BEFORE calling external tools that may overwrite it. Reference: capture_existing_pr_body() in submit_pipeline.py captures the PR body before gt submit overwrites it.

**calling gh or git directly from a slash command** → Read [Slash Command to Exec Migration](slash-command-exec-migration.md) first. Use an erk exec script instead. Direct CLI calls bypass gateways, making the logic untestable and unreusable.

**calling is_learned_docs_available() in CLI code** → Read [erk docs check Command](erk-docs-check.md) first. Function signature requires repo_ops and cwd kwargs: is_learned_docs_available(repo_ops=..., cwd=...). Omitting either kwarg will cause a TypeError.

**choosing between Ensure and EnsureIdeal** → Read [EnsureIdeal Pattern for Type Narrowing](ensure-ideal-pattern.md) first. Ensure is for invariant checks (preconditions). EnsureIdeal is for type narrowing (handling operations that can return non-ideal states). If the value comes from an operation that returns T | ErrorType, use EnsureIdeal.

**committing .impl/ folder to git** → Read [Plan-Implement Workflow](plan-implement.md) first. .impl/ lives in .gitignore and should never be committed. Only .erk/impl-context/ (remote execution artifact) gets committed and later removed.

**constructing RealRemoteGitHub directly in a command** → Read [Repo Resolution Pattern](repo-resolution-pattern.md) first. Use get_remote_github(ctx) instead. It handles test injection via ctx.remote_github and falls back to RealRemoteGitHub. See repo-resolution-pattern.md.

**creating a result dataclass without to_json_dict() method** → Read [Adding Machine JSON Commands](adding-json-to-commands.md) first. Result dataclasses should implement to_json_dict() for custom serialization. Without it, the serializer falls back to dataclasses.asdict() which may not handle complex types correctly.

**creating an MCP tool that parses human-readable CLI output** → Read [Agent-Friendly CLI Design Principles](agent-friendly-cli.md) first. MCP tools must call CLI commands with --json flag and parse structured JSON. Never parse human-readable text output.

**creating exec scripts for operations requiring LLM reasoning between steps** → Read [Slash Command LLM Turn Optimization](slash-command-llm-turn-optimization.md) first. Keep conditional logic in slash commands. Only bundle mechanical API calls where all input params are known upfront.

**deleting a CLI command without checking integration tests** → Read [Command Deletion Patterns](command-deletion-patterns.md) first. Grep tests/integration/ before deleting gateway methods used by the command. Integration tests may directly exercise the deleted method.

**displaying user-provided text in Rich CLI tables** → Read [CLI Output Styling Guide](output-styling.md) first. Use `escape_markup(value)` for user data. Brackets like `[text]` are interpreted as Rich style tags and will disappear.

**displaying user-provided text in Rich CLI tables without escaping** → Read [Objective Commands](objective-commands.md) first. Use `escape_markup(value)` for user data in Rich tables. Brackets like `[text]` are interpreted as style tags and will disappear.

**duplicating fetch/query logic in cli.py instead of calling run\_\*() from operation.py** → Read [Adding Machine JSON Commands](adding-json-to-commands.md) first. cli.py MUST delegate to the operation. The operation is the single source of truth for business logic. cli.py only marshals Click flags into the Request and renders the Result. Never re-fetch, re-query, or re-compute what the operation already returns.

**eagerly serializing rich objects in the Result dataclass** → Read [Adding Machine JSON Commands](adding-json-to-commands.md) first. Result dataclasses should carry rich domain objects (not pre-serialized dicts). Serialization belongs in to_json_dict() only. The human CLI needs rich objects for display; the machine adapter needs to_json_dict() for JSON.

**editing or deleting .impl/ folder during implementation** → Read [Plan-Implement Workflow](plan-implement.md) first. .impl/plan.md is immutable during implementation. Never edit it. Never delete .impl/ folder - it must be preserved for user review. Only .erk/impl-context/ should be auto-deleted.

**emitting human-readable text to stdout when --json is active** → Read [Agent-Friendly CLI Design Principles](agent-friendly-cli.md) first. When --json is active, stdout must contain only the JSON result object. Human output goes to stderr via user_output().

**exec reference check fails in CI** → Read [Auto-Generated Reference Documentation](auto-generated-reference-docs.md) first. Run 'erk-dev gen-exec-reference-docs' via devrun agent. This is routine maintenance after exec script changes, not a bug to investigate.

**expecting get-review-activity-log to fail on missing marker** → Read [Exec get-review-activity-log](exec-review-activity-log.md) first. The command always exits 0, even when the marker is not found. Check the 'found' field in the JSON response to determine whether the comment was located.

**expecting status to auto-update after manual PR edits** → Read [Update Objective Node Command](commands/update-objective-node.md) first. Only the update-objective-node command writes computed status. Manual edits require explicitly setting status to '-' to enable inference on next parse.

**filtering session sources without logging which sessions were skipped and why** → Read [Exec Script Schema Patterns](exec-script-schema-patterns.md) first. Silent filtering makes debugging impossible. Log to stderr when skipping sessions, include the reason (empty/warmup/filtered).

**flagging 5+ parameter violations in code review** → Read [Code Review Filtering](code-review-filtering.md) first. Before flagging, verify NO exception applies (ABC/Protocol/Click)

**generating directory-change commands using erk br co without source** → Read [Shell Activation Pattern for Worktree Navigation](shell-activation-pattern.md) first. Subprocess directory changes do NOT persist to the parent shell. erk br co runs in a subprocess — its chdir() is invisible to the caller. Use the shell activation pattern: source <(erk br co <branch> --script) to actually navigate.

**implementing a command with user confirmations interleaved between mutations** → Read [Two-Phase Validation Model](two-phase-validation-model.md) first. Use two-phase model: gather ALL confirmations first (Phase 1), then perform mutations (Phase 2). Interleaving confirmations with mutations causes partial state on decline.

**implementing a new `erk pr` command** → Read [PR Rewrite Command](pr-rewrite.md) first. Compare feature parity with `submit_pipeline.py`. Check: issue discovery, closing reference preservation, learn plan labels, footer construction, and plan details section. Use shared utilities from `shared.py` (`assemble_pr_body`, `discover_issue_for_footer`).

**implementing business logic with gateways** → Read [Dependency Injection in Exec Scripts](dependency-injection-patterns.md) first. Never create gateway instances in business logic — inject them as parameters

**implementing internal CLI functions** → Read [Dependency Injection in Exec Scripts](dependency-injection-patterns.md) first. Separate \_\*\_impl() functions return exit codes or discriminated unions, never call sys.exit()

**importing from erk_shared.gateway.{service}.abc when creating exec commands** → Read [Exec Script Patterns](exec-script-patterns.md) first. Gateway ABCs use submodule paths: `erk_shared.gateway.{service}.{resource}.abc`

**initiating a rebase inside erk pr resolve-conflicts** → Read [Resolve Conflicts Workflow](rebase-confirmation-workflow.md) first. erk pr resolve-conflicts does NOT initiate rebases. It requires an active rebase already in progress. Users start the rebase themselves (git rebase, gt restack), then call this command.

**landing a PR without updating associated learn plan status** → Read [Learn Plan Land Flow](learn-plan-land-flow.md) first. Learn plan PRs trigger special execution pipeline steps that update parent plan metadata. Ensure check_learn_status and update_learn_plan steps execute after merge.

**launching Claude for conflict resolution without showing conflicted files first** → Read [Resolve Conflicts Workflow](rebase-confirmation-workflow.md) first. Always show conflicted files and get user confirmation before launching Claude. See rebase-confirmation-workflow.md.

**making 5+ sequential gh api subprocess calls in an exec script** → Read [Exec Script Performance Patterns](exec-script-performance.md) first. Each gh subprocess costs ~200-300ms. Bundle related API calls into a single exec script invocation or use the HTTP direct API path via PrListService.

**making LLM fetch data sequentially when it could be bundled** → Read [Slash Command LLM Turn Optimization](slash-command-llm-turn-optimization.md) first. Extract 3+ mechanical sequential calls into an exec script. Each tool call costs a full LLM round-trip.

**making a separate subprocess call for each item in a batch operation** → Read [Exec Script Performance Patterns](exec-script-performance.md) first. Use batch exec commands pattern (batch-exec-commands.md) to process items in a single invocation with per-item error handling.

**making session discovery failures block the land command** → Read [Land-Learn Integration](land-learn-integration.md) first. Session discovery uses fire-and-forget error resilience. The entire learn workflow is wrapped in try/except to prevent blocking land. Failures are reported as warnings, never errors.

**making session_id a required parameter for a new command** → Read [Session ID Availability and Propagation](session-management.md) first. Check the fail-hard vs degrade decision table below. Most commands should accept session_id as optional.

**manually deleting branches that were merged via GitHub web UI** → Read [erk reconcile Command](commands/reconcile.md) first. Use erk reconcile instead. It handles the full lifecycle: learn PR creation, objective updates, slot cleanup, branch deletion, and worktree removal.

**manually parsing --repo owner/repo in a command handler** → Read [Repo Resolution Pattern](repo-resolution-pattern.md) first. Use resolved_repo_option decorator instead. It handles parsing, validation, and injection of GitHubRepoId. See repo-resolution-pattern.md.

**modifying learn plan skip guards in land_learn.py** → Read [Land-Learn Integration](land-learn-integration.md) first. Learn plan creation may skip silently when no sessions exist. Check land-learn-integration.md before modifying skip guards.

**modifying teleport in-place without updating slot assignment** → Read [Teleport Slot Awareness](teleport-slot-awareness.md) first. When teleporting in-place, the current worktree's slot assignment must be updated to track the new branch. Missing this breaks the slot pool's branch tracking. See `_teleport_in_place()` in teleport_cmd.py.

**moving uv sync inside the VIRTUAL_ENV guard** → Read [Activation Scripts](activation-scripts.md) first. uv sync runs OUTSIDE the guard (always executes, even on re-entry). This ensures deps stay current after branch switches in reused slots. Only venv activation, .env loading, and shell completion go inside the guard.

**mutating SubmitState fields directly** → Read [PR Submit Pipeline Architecture](pr-submit-pipeline.md) first. SubmitState is frozen. Use dataclasses.replace(state, field=value) to create new state.

**naming a JSON output flag --json-output instead of --json** → Read [Agent-Friendly CLI Design Principles](agent-friendly-cli.md) first. Standardized flag name is --json (not --json-output). See agent-friendly-cli.md for the naming decision.

**parsing roadmap tables to update PR cells** → Read [Update Objective Node Command](commands/update-objective-node.md) first. Use the update-objective-node command instead of manual parsing. The command encodes table structure knowledge once rather than duplicating it across callers.

**passing --pr flag to erk pr rewrite** → Read [PR Rewrite Command](pr-rewrite.md) first. Do NOT pass --pr to erk pr rewrite; the command auto-discovers the PR from the current branch. The --pr flag does not exist.

**placing @mcp_exposed below @machine_command in decorator stack** → Read [Adding Machine JSON Commands](adding-json-to-commands.md) first. @mcp_exposed must be ABOVE @machine_command. Correct order: @mcp_exposed > @machine_command > @click.command.

**plan-implement exists in WORKFLOW_COMMAND_MAP but erk launch plan-implement always raises UsageError** → Read [Workflow Commands](workflow-commands.md) first. use erk pr submit instead

**promoting a nested command to top-level** → Read [CLI Command Promotion Pattern](command-promotion.md) first. Three files must be updated: cli.py (import + add_command), help_formatter.py (top_level_commands list), and the command module (help text). See command-promotion.md.

**putting business logic in the machine adapter** → Read [Machine Command Architecture](json-command-decorator.md) first. Machine adapters should be thin wrappers. Put shared logic in \*\_operation.py files.

**putting checkout-specific helpers in navigation_helpers.py** → Read [Checkout Helpers Module](checkout-helpers.md) first. `src/erk/cli/commands/navigation_helpers.py` imports from `wt.create_cmd`, which creates a cycle if navigation_helpers tries to import from `wt` subpackage. Keep checkout-specific helpers in separate `checkout_helpers.py` module instead.

**removing a CLI parameter without checking all consumers** → Read [Parameter Addition Checklist](parameter-addition-checklist.md) first. When removing a CLI parameter, verify: (1) @click.option decorator, (2) function signature, (3) all call sites, (4) helper functions, (5) ctx.invoke calls. Then run erk-dev gen-exec-reference-docs.

**removing a CLI parameter without checking all consumers** → Read [CLI Parameter Removal Checklist](parameter-removal-checklist.md) first. When removing a CLI parameter, verify: (1) @click.option decorator, (2) function signature, (3) all call sites, (4) helper functions, (5) ctx.invoke calls. Then run erk-dev gen-exec-reference-docs.

**removing a command without checking docs/learned/ for references** → Read [Command Deletion Patterns](command-deletion-patterns.md) first. Run the post-refactoring documentation audit (post-refactor-documentation-audit.md) after any command deletion.

**removing a workflow command or CLI entry** → Read [Incomplete Command Removal Pattern](incomplete-command-removal.md) first. Read incomplete-command-removal.md first. Search all string references before removing. String-based dispatch maps like WORKFLOW_COMMAND_MAP aren't caught by type checkers.

**removing the VIRTUAL_ENV guard from activation scripts** → Read [Activation Scripts](activation-scripts.md) first. Guard prevents double activation when direnv and temp script both source activation. Removing it causes duplicate venv activation and .env loading. Moving uv sync OUTSIDE the guard is correct — guard only protects venv activation, .env loading, and shell completion.

**renaming CLI commands without checking workflow files** → Read [Command Rename Checklist](command-rename-checklist.md) first. After renaming CLI commands, grep .github/workflows/\*.yml for stale references.

**renaming a CLI command without checking downstream packages** → Read [Command Rename Checklist](command-rename-checklist.md) first. CLI command renames in src/erk/cli/ may break downstream packages. Grep: rg --type py 'CliRunner.*invoke.*cli' packages/

**renaming an exec command without updating all 9 reference locations** → Read [Command Rename Checklist](command-rename-checklist.md) first. Follow the 9-place checklist in command-rename-checklist.md to avoid stale references.

**resolving --ref and --ref-current manually in a command handler** → Read [Ref Resolution Patterns](ref-resolution-patterns.md) first. Use resolve_dispatch_ref() from ref_resolution.py. It handles mutual exclusivity, detached HEAD detection, and config fallback. See ref-resolution-patterns.md.

**retrieving dependencies in Click commands** → Read [Dependency Injection in Exec Scripts](dependency-injection-patterns.md) first. Click commands retrieve real implementations from context via require\_\* helpers

**returning MachineCommandError without raising SystemExit** → Read [Machine Command Architecture](json-command-decorator.md) first. The @machine_command decorator handles serialization and exit codes. Just return MachineCommandError from the callback.

**returning non-zero exit code when --json flag is active** → Read [Agent-Friendly CLI Design Principles](agent-friendly-cli.md) first. JSON mode must always exit 0. Errors are communicated via {success: false, error_type, message} in stdout JSON, not via exit codes.

**running any erk exec subcommand** → Read [erk exec Commands](erk-exec-commands.md) first. Check syntax with `erk exec <command> -h` first, or load erk-exec skill for workflow guidance.

**running gh pr create** → Read [PR Operations: Duplicate Prevention and Detection](pr-operations.md) first. Query for existing PRs first via `gh pr list --head <branch> --state all`. Prevents duplicate PR creation and workflow breaks.

**skipping session push after local implementation** → Read [Plan-Implement Workflow](plan-implement.md) first. Local implementations must push session via capture-session-info + push-session. This enables async learn workflow. See session upload section below.

**submitting PRs** → Read [PR Submission Decision Framework](pr-submission.md) first. Before creating PRs, understand the workflow tradeoffs

**testing prompts without matching confirm_responses array length** → Read [Prompt Consolidation Pattern](prompt-consolidation-pattern.md) first. confirm_responses array length must match the number of prompts. Too few causes IndexError; too many indicates a prompt was removed without updating tests.

**using EnsureIdeal for discriminated union narrowing** → Read [EnsureIdeal Pattern for Type Narrowing](ensure-ideal-pattern.md) first. Only use when the error type implements NonIdealState protocol OR provides a message field. For custom error types without standard fields, add a specific EnsureIdeal method.

**using Path.cwd() or Path.home() in exec scripts** → Read [Exec Script Patterns](exec-script-patterns.md) first. Use context injection via require_cwd(ctx) for testability

**using Python format strings with :N width specifiers for CLI output containing emoji** → Read [CLI Output Styling Guide](output-styling.md) first. Use Rich tables instead — emoji have variable terminal widths (typically 2 cells) which break fixed-width alignment. See the Rich Tables for Variable-Width Characters section below.

**using a non-None default for an optional Click option** → Read [Click Framework Conventions](click-framework-conventions.md) first. Use default=None to distinguish 'not provided' from 'explicitly set'. This enables three-state semantics (None=omitted, ''=clear, value=set) used throughout erk's CLI.

**using blocking operations (user confirmation, editor launch) in CI-executed code paths** → Read [CI-Aware Commands](ci-aware-commands.md) first. Check `in_github_actions()` before any blocking operation. CI has no terminal for user input.

**using click.confirm() after user_output()** → Read [CLI Output Styling Guide](output-styling.md) first. Use ctx.console.confirm() for testability, or user_confirm() if no context available. Direct click.confirm() after user_output() causes buffering hangs because stderr isn't flushed.

**using ctx.invoke() with kwargs that don't match target function parameter names** → Read [PR Submit Pipeline Architecture](pr-submit-pipeline.md) first. Click ctx.invoke() forwards kwargs directly — any name mismatch causes runtime TypeError. Verify all parameter names exactly match the target function signature.

**using dict .get() to access fields from exec script JSON output without a TypedDict schema** → Read [Exec Script Schema Patterns](exec-script-schema-patterns.md) first. Silent filtering failures occur when field names are mistyped. Define TypedDict in erk_shared and use cast() in consumers.

**using erk exec commands in scripts** → Read [erk exec Commands](erk-exec-commands.md) first. Some erk exec subcommands don't support `--format json`. Always check with `erk exec <command> -h` first.

**using gh issue view on a plan without checking plan backend type** → Read [CLI Backend-Aware Display Patterns](backend-aware-display.md) first. Planned PR plan IDs are PR numbers, not issue numbers. Using gh issue view on a planned-PR plan produces a confusing 404. Route to gh pr view based on backend type.

**using ls -t or mtime to find the current session** → Read [Session ID Availability and Propagation](session-management.md) first. Use the ClaudeInstallation gateway or the session-id-injector-hook's scratch file instead. Mtime-based discovery is racy in parallel sessions.

**using os.environ to read CLAUDE_SESSION_ID** → Read [Session ID Availability and Propagation](session-management.md) first. CLAUDE_SESSION_ID is NOT an environment variable. It's a Claude Code string substitution in commands/skills, and arrives via stdin JSON in hooks.

**using this pattern** → Read [Local/Remote Command Group Pattern (Deprecated)](local-remote-command-groups.md) first. BEFORE: Using invoke_without_command=True to unify local/remote variants → READ: Why this pattern was abandoned

**using this pattern** → Read [Workflow Commands](workflow-commands.md) first. PR workflows automatically update plan dispatch metadata when the branch follows the plnd/ prefix naming pattern

**validating PRs in workflows** → Read [PR Submission Decision Framework](pr-submission.md) first. PR validation rules apply to both workflows

**writing Examples sections in CLI docstrings without ** → Read [Click Help Text Formatting](help-text-formatting.md) first. Place  on its own line after 'Examples:' heading. Without it, Click rewraps text and breaks formatting.

**writing PR/issue body generation in exec scripts** → Read [Exec Command Patterns](exec-command-patterns.md) first. Use `_build_pr_body` and `_build_issue_comment` patterns from handle_no_changes.py for consistency and testability.

**writing multi-line error messages in Ensure method calls** → Read [CLI Output Styling Guide](output-styling.md) first. Use implicit string concatenation with \n at end of first string. Line 1 is the primary error, line 2+ is remediation context. Do NOT use \n\n (double newline) — Ensure handles spacing.
