# Resolve Conflicts Workflow

The `erk pr resolve-conflicts` command resolves merge conflicts from an **already in-progress rebase**. It does not initiate a rebase.

## Source

`src/erk/cli/commands/pr/resolve_conflicts_cmd.py`

## Scope

This command requires a rebase already in progress. If no rebase is detected, it exits with an error:

```
No rebase in progress. Start a rebase first with 'git rebase <branch>',
'gt restack', etc., then run this command when conflicts arise.
```

Users initiate the rebase themselves using standard tools:

```bash
git rebase main        # hits conflicts
erk pr resolve-conflicts

gt restack --no-interactive   # hits conflicts
erk pr resolve-conflicts
```

The command is deliberately scoped to conflict resolution only — it does not call `gt restack` or `git rebase` internally.

Detects an existing rebase in progress via `is_rebase_in_progress()` at `resolve_conflicts_cmd.py:61`. Displays "Rebase in progress" message and falls through to confirmation.

**Important:** When `is_rebase_in_progress()` returns true, the **entire rebase state validation is skipped** — not just a tracking check. No branch tracking validation, upstream check, or other preconditions are verified. Reason: in-progress rebases may have detached HEAD (different git state model), making tracking-based checks unreliable. The sole precondition is confirming a rebase is actually in progress.

## Confirmation Pattern

After detecting a rebase in progress, the command:

1. Checks `ctx.git.rebase.is_rebase_in_progress(cwd)`
2. Retrieves conflicted files via `ctx.git.status.get_conflicted_files(cwd)`
3. Displays each conflicted file with red bold styling
4. Prompts: `click.confirm("Launch Claude to resolve conflicts?", default=True)`
5. On decline, exits with message to run the command again when ready
6. On confirm, launches Claude via `executor.execute_interactive()` with `/erk:pr-resolve-conflicts` command

The `execute_interactive()` call uses `os.execvp()` — code after it never executes.

## Options

- `--dangerous` / `--safe`: Override the `live_dangerously` config setting for Claude permission mode

## Slash Command

Claude is launched with `/erk:pr-resolve-conflicts` (not `/erk:rebase` — that was the old command).
