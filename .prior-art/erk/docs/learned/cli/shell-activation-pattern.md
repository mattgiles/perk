# Shell Activation Pattern for Worktree Navigation

## The Problem

`erk br co <branch>` switches to a worktree by finding which worktree has the branch checked out. However, when run as a subprocess, any directory change it makes is invisible to the calling shell.

**This does NOT navigate the shell:**

```bash
erk br co feature-branch && some-command   # Wrong: chdir() happened in subprocess
```

**This DOES navigate the shell:**

```bash
source <(erk br co feature-branch --script)
```

## How It Works

`erk br co --script` outputs the shell activation script content to stdout. The activation script:

1. Sources the worktree's virtual environment
2. Changes the shell's working directory to the worktree root
3. Loads `.env` files if present

By wrapping in `source <(...)`, the shell evaluates the script content in the current process via process substitution, making the directory change persistent.

## Implementation

**Location:** `src/erk/cli/activation.py`

Key functions:

- `activation_config_for_implement()` — Creates config with `implement: True` to append `erk implement` to the source command
- `activation_config_activate_only()` — Creates config for navigation without implementing
- `build_activation_command(config, script_path)` — Builds the final command string

The resulting command format:

```bash
source /path/to/worktree/.erk/bin/activate.sh && erk implement
```

## Post-CD Command Execution

Activation scripts support appending commands after the `cd` line via `post_cd_commands`. These run in the target directory after navigation completes.

**Used by:** PR teleport with `--sync` flag — appends `gt submit --no-interactive` so the branch is submitted to Graphite after teleport navigation.

## Usage in TUI and Plan Checkout

The TUI's "copy prepare" commands use `activation_config_for_implement()` to build clipboard commands that navigate to a worktree and start implementation. The `--script` flag on `erk br co` enables this pattern.
