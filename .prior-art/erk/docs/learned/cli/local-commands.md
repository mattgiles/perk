# Local Command Patterns

Local commands (`.claude/commands/local/`) are agent instruction files that extend Claude Code with project-specific capabilities. This document describes the patterns and taxonomy for erk local commands.

## Command Categories

### Batch Audit Commands

Batch audit commands scan the repository comprehensively and categorize multiple items:

| Command           | Scope            | Purpose                              |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `/audit-branches` | All branches/PRs | Identify stale branches and cleanup  |
| `/audit-plans`    | All open erk-prs | Identify stale or completed plans    |
| `/audit-scan`     | docs/learned/    | Scan docs for audit priority         |
| `/audit-doc`      | Single doc file  | Deep audit of one documentation file |

**Characteristics:**

- Multi-phase workflow with data collection and analysis
- Presents categorized tables of results
- User selects items to act upon
- Higher context cost (reads many items)

### Single-Item Assessment Commands

Single-item assessment commands analyze one specific item in detail:

| Command             | Input            | Purpose                                           |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `/check-superceded` | PR number        | Assess if PR's work has been superseded in master |
| `/objective-view`   | Objective number | View progress and associations for an objective   |

**Characteristics:**

- Focused, inline during development workflow
- Evidence-based verdict with classification
- Lower context cost (single item analysis)
- Immediate actionability

## Design Decision: When to Use Each Pattern

**Use batch audit when:**

- Periodic cleanup operations
- Comprehensive repository health checks
- User needs to see "big picture" of staleness

**Use single-item assessment when:**

- User is actively working on or reviewing specific item
- Quick decision needed during development flow
- Deep analysis of one item is more valuable than broad scan
