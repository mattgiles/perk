# PR Rewrite Command

`erk pr rewrite` replaces the old multi-step workflow (`gt squash` + `erk pr summarize` + push) with a single command that handles the full cycle.

## 6-Phase Pipeline

<!-- Source: src/erk/cli/commands/pr/rewrite_cmd.py, _execute_pr_rewrite -->

The command executes six phases sequentially:

1. **Validate** — Checks Claude CLI availability, current branch, and that a PR exists
2. **Squash** — Idempotent squash via `execute_squash()` (works whether 1 or N commits)
3. **Extract diff** — Gets the diff between current branch and parent via `execute_diff_extraction()`
4. **Generate AI title/body** — Uses `CommitMessageGenerator` with optional plan context from linked erk plan
5. **Amend commit** — Rewrites the local commit with the AI-generated message
6. **Push and update PR** — Force-pushes via `branch_manager.submit_branch()`, updates PR title/body on GitHub

## Key Behaviors

**Idempotent squash**: Uses `execute_squash()` which works correctly whether the branch has 1 commit or N commits. Safe to run repeatedly.

**Graphite retracking**: After amending, the command retracks the branch via `ctx.graphite_branch_ops.retrack_branch()` to fix tracking divergence caused by the amend.

**PR body composition**: Uses shared `assemble_pr_body()` from `shared.py` for consistent body format including plan details section and footer with closing reference.

**Learn plan label handling**: Detects learn plan origin via `is_learn_plan()` and adds `ERK_SKIP_LEARN_LABEL` to skip redundant learn processing.

**Issue discovery**: Uses shared `discover_issue_for_footer()` for two-step issue discovery (`.erk/impl-context/plan-ref.json` primary, with legacy `.erk/impl-context/issue.json` fallback, then existing PR body fallback).

## Flags

- `--debug` — Shows diagnostic output from squash and diff extraction phases

## Auto-Discovery Pattern

`erk pr rewrite` auto-discovers the PR from the current branch — it does not accept a `--pr` flag. The command calls `discover_branch_context()` internally to determine which PR to rewrite based on the checked-out branch.

**Do NOT pass `--pr` to `erk pr rewrite`** — the flag does not exist. If you see `--pr` in workflow YAML or scripts, it is a bug (fixed in PR #8439).

## Usage

```bash
# Rewrite current PR with AI-generated message (auto-discovers from branch)
erk pr rewrite

# Show debug output
erk pr rewrite --debug
```
