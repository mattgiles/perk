# Activation Scripts

## Overview

Erk generates `.erk/activate.sh` scripts in worktrees to provide a shell-sourceable environment setup. This enables opt-in shell integration where users explicitly source the script rather than relying on automatic shell manipulation.

## What the Script Does

When sourced, `.erk/activate.sh`:

1. CDs to the worktree directory
2. Creates `.venv` with `uv sync` if not present
3. Sources `.venv/bin/activate` if present
4. Loads `.env` file (using `set -a` for allexport)
5. Runs configured post-create commands
6. Displays activation confirmation

## Key Functions

| Function                            | Purpose                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `render_activation_script()`        | Generates script content (used for navigation too)     |
| `write_worktree_activate_script()`  | Writes `.erk/activate.sh`, creates directory if needed |
| `ensure_worktree_activate_script()` | Idempotent version (create only if missing)            |

**Source:** `src/erk/cli/activation.py`

## When Scripts Are Generated

Scripts are generated during worktree creation:

- `erk wt create` - writes script after creating worktree
- `run_post_worktree_setup()` - shared function for all worktree creation paths

## Configuration

Post-create commands from `.erk/config.toml` are embedded in the script:

```toml
[post_create]
shell = "bash"
commands = [
  "uv run make dev_install",
]
```

## Transparency Logging

Scripts include `__erk_log()` helpers respecting:

- `ERK_QUIET=1` - Suppresses output
- `ERK_VERBOSE=1` - Shows detailed paths

## Post-CD Commands

Activation scripts support dynamic post-CD commands via the `post_cd_commands` parameter in `render_activation_script()`. These commands are appended after the `cd` line and execute in the target worktree directory.

**Example:** PR teleport with `--sync` flag passes `["gt submit --no-interactive"]` as `post_cd_commands`, causing the branch to be submitted to Graphite after navigation.

**Implementation:** `packages/erk-slots/src/erk_slots/teleport_cmd.py` uses the `post_cd_commands` parameter when `sync=True`.

## `force_script_activation` Parameter

<!-- Source: src/erk/cli/commands/branch/checkout_cmd.py, _perform_checkout -->

`_perform_checkout()` in `src/erk/cli/commands/branch/checkout_cmd.py` accepts a `force_script_activation: bool` parameter. When `True`, the function emits the activation script even if the user didn't pass `--script` on the command line.

This is used for **stack-in-place** operations: when the user checks out a plan branch within the current slot (rather than switching worktrees), the activation script is automatically emitted so shell integration can source it. The effective flag is computed as `effective_script = script or force_script_activation`.

**Call sites:**

See `_branch_checkout_impl()` in `src/erk/cli/commands/branch/checkout_cmd.py` for call sites to `_perform_checkout()`:

- Stack-in-place checkout paths: `force_script_activation=True`
- Normal checkout paths: `force_script_activation=False`

## VIRTUAL_ENV Idempotency Guard

When `erk pr checkout --script` generates an activation script and direnv is active, the script can be sourced twice: once by direnv (which triggers on the `cd` inside the script) and once by the temp script execution itself. This causes duplicate `uv sync`, `uv pip install`, `.env` loading, and shell completion setup.

### Solution

Dependency sync (`uv sync`) always runs unconditionally (outside the guard). The `VIRTUAL_ENV` guard only protects idempotent side effects:

```bash
# Always sync deps (outside guard — handles branch switches in reused slots)
uv sync --quiet

# Guard only protects venv activation, .env loading, shell completion
if [ "$VIRTUAL_ENV" != "{worktree_path}/.venv" ]; then
  unset VIRTUAL_ENV
  . {worktree_path}/.venv/bin/activate
  # Load .env into the environment
  set -a; . ./.env; set +a
  # Shell completion
  eval "$(erk completion bash)"  # or zsh
fi
```

### Guard Scope

**OUTSIDE guard** (always runs):

- Dependency sync (`uv sync --quiet`) — ensures deps are current after branch switches in reused slots
- Post-activation commands (e.g., `gt submit --no-interactive`)
- Final status message

**INSIDE guard** (skipped on re-entry):

- venv activation (`. .venv/bin/activate`)
- `.env` loading (`set -a`)
- Shell completion setup (`eval "$(erk completion ...)"`)

### Implementation

<!-- Source: src/erk/cli/activation.py, render_activation_script -->

`render_activation_script()` in `src/erk/cli/activation.py` generates the guard. `uv sync` runs unconditionally before the guard, while venv activation, `.env` loading, and shell completion are inside the `VIRTUAL_ENV` guard. The guard checks if `$VIRTUAL_ENV` already points to this worktree's `.venv` directory, and if so, skips activation entirely.
