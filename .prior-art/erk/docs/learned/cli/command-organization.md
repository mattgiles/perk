# CLI Command Organization

## Design Philosophy: Plan-Oriented Interface

Erk's CLI is organized around the principle that **plans are the dominant noun** in the user's workflow. This design decision prioritizes ergonomics for the most common operations while maintaining clarity through consistent grouping patterns.

### Core Principle: Plan as First-Class Citizen

Plans represent implementation work to be done. Since users interact with plans more frequently than they manipulate worktrees or stacks directly, plan-related commands are placed at the top level for minimal keystrokes and maximum discoverability.

**Top-level plan commands:**

```bash
erk dash          # Display plan dashboard
erk implement     # Implement a plan in current directory
erk prepare       # Create a worktree from a plan

# Plan submission operations are under `erk pr`:
erk pr dispatch   # Submit a plan for remote execution

# Plan creation, view/close/log/replan operations are under `erk pr`:
erk pr create     # Create a new plan
erk pr view       # View a plan
erk pr close      # Close a plan
erk pr log        # View plan execution logs
erk pr replan     # Replan a plan
```

**Why top-level?**

- Highest-frequency entry points: `implement`, `prepare`, and `dash` are the most common workflow starters
- Natural mental model: "I want to work on a plan" → `erk implement 42`
- Plan management via `erk pr <subcommand>`: `dispatch`, `list`, `create`, `view`, `close`, `log`, `replan`

## Command Categories

### Top-Level Plan Operations

Only the highest-frequency workflow entry points are at the top level:

| Command     | Description                           | Frequency |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `dash`      | Display plan dashboard                | Very High |
| `implement` | Implement a plan in current directory | Very High |
| `prepare`   | Create a worktree from a plan         | High      |

### `erk pr` Subcommands

Plan and PR operations are under the `erk pr` group:

| Subcommand        | Description                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `create`          | Create a new plan                              |
| `view`            | View a plan                                    |
| `close`           | Close a plan                                   |
| `list`            | List open plans                                |
| `log`             | View plan execution logs                       |
| `replan`          | Replan an existing plan                        |
| `dispatch`        | Submit a plan for remote execution             |
| `submit`          | Submit current branch as a pull request        |
| `address`         | Address PR review comments with AI resolution  |
| `check`           | Validate PR rules for the current branch       |
| `checkout` (`co`) | Checkout PR into a worktree for review         |
| `rebase`          | Fix merge conflicts with AI resolution         |
| `rewrite`         | Squash, regenerate commit message, push        |
| `sync`            | Synchronize current PR branch with remote base |
| `diverge-fix`     | Fix branch divergence with remote              |

### Grouped Commands

Infrastructure and supporting operations are grouped under noun prefixes for clarity:

#### Worktree Operations (`erk wt <verb>`)

Worktree manipulation is a supporting operation, not the primary workflow:

```bash
erk wt create <name>        # Create a new worktree
erk wt delete <name>        # Delete a worktree
erk wt list                 # List worktrees
erk wt checkout <branch>    # Switch to worktree for branch
```

**Why grouped?**

- Lower frequency: Worktrees are created implicitly during plan implementation, not managed directly
- Infrastructure concern: Users think "I want to implement this plan" not "I want a worktree"
- Namespace clarity: Avoids collision with plan commands

#### Stack Operations (`erk stack <verb>`)

Graphite stack management for dependent branches:

```bash
erk stack consolidate      # Consolidate stack changes
erk stack list             # List stack items
erk stack move             # Move item in stack
erk stack split            # Split stack at a point
```

**Why grouped?**

- Graphite-specific: Only relevant when using stacked workflows
- Advanced usage: Not part of basic plan workflow
- Clear domain: "Stack" immediately indicates Graphite operations

### Navigation Commands (Top-Level)

Branch/worktree navigation commands are top-level because they're fundamental movement operations:

```bash
erk br co <branch>         # Switch to worktree for branch (alias for erk branch checkout)
erk up                     # Navigate to parent branch
erk down                   # Navigate to child branch
```

**Why top-level?**

- Very high frequency: Navigation is constant during development
- Movement primitive: Like `cd` in shell, should be minimal keystrokes
- Natural workflow: "Switch to that branch" → `erk br co feature-branch`

### Setup and Configuration

Initial setup commands (used once or rarely):

```bash
erk init                   # Initialize erk in repository
erk config                 # Configure erk settings
```

## Decision Framework

When adding a new command, use this flowchart to determine placement:

```

## Good Patterns

### ✅ Plan Operations: Top-Level vs `erk pr` Subcommands

```bash
# GOOD: Top-level for highest-frequency entry points
erk implement 42
erk prepare 42
erk dash

# GOOD: erk pr subcommands for plan submission and management
erk pr dispatch 42
erk pr create --file plan.md
erk pr view 42
erk pr close 42
```

**Why?** Only `implement`, `prepare`, and `dash` are top-level — they are the most common workflow entry points. Plan submission and management (dispatch/create/view/close/log/replan) all live under `erk pr`.

### ✅ Infrastructure Grouped Under Noun

```bash
# GOOD: Clear namespace, infrastructure is grouped
erk wt create my-feature
erk wt delete old-feature
erk stack consolidate

# BAD: Conflicts with plan operations, unclear ownership
erk create my-feature     # Is this a plan or worktree?
erk delete old-feature    # What am I deleting?
erk consolidate           # Consolidate what?
```

**Why?** Grouping clarifies the target domain and prevents naming collisions.

### ✅ Navigation as Movement Primitives

```bash
# GOOD: Minimal, like shell commands (cd, ls)
erk br co feature-branch
erk up
erk down

# BAD: Over-grouped, breaks natural flow
erk nav checkout feature-branch
erk nav up
erk nav down
```

**Why?** Navigation is a fundamental movement operation, should be as lightweight as possible.

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Top-Level Infrastructure Commands

```bash
# BAD: Name collision, unclear scope
erk create <name>         # Create what? Plan or worktree?
erk delete <name>         # Delete what?

# GOOD: Explicit namespace
erk pr create --file plan.md    # Clearly a plan
erk wt create <name>            # Clearly a worktree
erk wt delete <name>            # Clearly a worktree
```

### ❌ Inconsistent Grouping

```bash
# BAD: Some worktree ops grouped, others not
erk wt create
erk wt delete
erk list-worktrees        # Should be: erk wt list

# GOOD: Consistent grouping
erk wt create
erk wt delete
erk wt list
```

## Examples by Category

### Plan Lifecycle

```bash
# Create a plan
erk pr create --file implementation-plan.md

# View plans
erk dash                  # Display plan dashboard
erk pr view 42            # View specific plan

# Work on a plan
erk implement 42          # Set up .erk/impl-context/ and implement in current directory

# Submit for execution
erk pr dispatch 42        # Queue for remote execution

# Track progress
erk pr log 42             # View execution history

# Finish
erk pr close 42           # Close completed plan
```

### Worktree Management

```bash
# Create worktrees
erk wt create my-feature

# List and inspect
erk wt list               # List worktrees

# Clean up
erk wt delete my-feature
erk wt checkout my-branch # Switch to worktree for branch
```

### Navigation

```bash
# Switch between branches
erk br co feature-branch

# Navigate stack
erk up                    # Move to parent branch
erk down                  # Move to child branch
```

## Implementation Reference

### Adding a New Command

**Step 1: Determine placement** using the decision framework above

**Step 2: Create command file**

- PR command: `src/erk/cli/commands/pr/<name>_cmd.py`
- Worktree command: `src/erk/cli/commands/wt/<name>_cmd.py`
- Stack command: `src/erk/cli/commands/stack/<name>_cmd.py`
- Top-level: `src/erk/cli/commands/<name>.py`

**Step 3: Register in `src/erk/cli/cli.py`**

For pr subcommands:

<!-- Source: src/erk/cli/commands/pr/__init__.py, pr_group.add_command -->

See `pr_group.add_command` in `src/erk/cli/commands/pr/__init__.py` for the registration pattern.

For grouped commands:

```python
from erk.cli.commands.wt.create_cmd import create_wt

wt_group.add_command(create_wt)  # Grouped under wt
```

**Step 4: Add tests**

- PR commands: `tests/commands/pr/test_<name>.py`
- Worktree commands: `tests/commands/wt/test_<name>.py`
- Stack commands: `tests/commands/stack/test_<name>.py`

| Worktree commands | `src/erk/cli/commands/wt/`                                                                                  |
| Stack commands    | `src/erk/cli/commands/stack/`                                                                               |
| Navigation        | `src/erk/cli/commands/branch/checkout_cmd.py`, `src/erk/cli/commands/up.py`, `src/erk/cli/commands/down.py` |
| Setup             | `src/erk/cli/commands/init/` (directory), `src/erk/cli/commands/config.py`                                  |

## Case Study: Reclassifying `launch`, `one-shot`, `workflow`

<!-- Source: src/erk/cli/help_formatter.py:244-278 -->

PR #8600 reclassified three commands based on frequency-of-use analysis:

| Command    | Previous Classification | New Classification | Rationale                                                          |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `launch`   | Command Groups          | Top-Level Commands | High-frequency entry point for remote operations                   |
| `one-shot` | Hidden (`hidden=True`)  | Top-Level Commands | Primary autonomous workflow; hiding reduced discoverability        |
| `workflow` | Top-Level Commands      | Command Groups     | Low-frequency infrastructure; `workflow smoke-test` is rarely used |

The reclassification is implemented in `src/erk/cli/help_formatter.py` (lines 244-278), where `top_level_commands` and `command_groups` lists control `erk --help` output ordering.

**Key change for `one-shot`:** The `hidden=True` parameter was removed from `@click.command("one-shot")` in `src/erk/cli/commands/one_shot.py`, making it visible in help output. Previously, users had to know the command existed.
