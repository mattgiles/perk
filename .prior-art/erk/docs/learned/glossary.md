# Erk Glossary

Definitive terminology reference for the erk project.

**Purpose**: Eliminate confusion about domain-specific terms. When in doubt about terminology, consult this document.

## Core Concepts

### activate.sh

A shell script at `.erk/activate.sh` in each worktree that sets up the development environment when sourced.

**Purpose**: Opt-in shell integration. Users explicitly source this script rather than relying on automatic shell manipulation.

**What it does**:

1. CDs to the worktree directory
2. Sets up Python virtual environment (via `uv sync`)
3. Sources `.venv/bin/activate`
4. Loads `.env` file
5. Runs post-create commands

**Usage**:

```bash
source ~/erks/erk/my-feature/.erk/activate.sh
```

**Generation**: Created by `write_worktree_activate_script()` during worktree creation.

**Related**: [Activation Scripts](cli/activation-scripts.md)

### Worktree

Git's native feature for creating additional working directories for a repository.

**Technical**: Created with `git worktree add`, allows working on multiple branches simultaneously without switching branches in a single directory.

**Example**:

```bash
git worktree add ../feature-branch feature-branch
```

### Erk

A **managed worktree** created and maintained by the erk tool.

**Distinction from worktree**:

- **Worktree** = git's feature (any directory managed by git worktree)
- **Erk** = worktree + configuration + environment setup + lifecycle management

**Features**:

- Stored in standardized location (`~/erks/<repo>/<name>`)
- Automatic `.env` file generation
- Post-creation hook execution
- Integration with graphite/GitHub

**Example**: `erk create my-feature` creates both a git worktree and an erk.

### Repo Root

The main git repository directory containing `.git/` directory.

**Location**: Where you originally cloned the repository.

**Example**: If you cloned to `/Users/you/projects/erk`, that's the repo root.

**Note**: In a worktree, `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` points back to the repo root's `.git` directory.

### Root Worktree

The primary git worktree where the `.git` directory lives (as opposed to linked worktrees which have `.git` files pointing elsewhere).

**Terminology Note**: Use "root worktree" (not "main worktree") to avoid confusion with the "main" branch. This ensures "main" unambiguously refers to the branch name.

**In Code**: `WorktreeInfo.is_root` field identifies the root worktree. Always use this instead of path comparison.

**Detection**:

- ✅ Correct: `if wt.is_root:`
- ❌ Wrong: `if wt.path == repo_root:` (fails from non-root worktrees)

**Related**: [Root Worktree Detection](architecture/erk-architecture.md#root-worktree-detection)

### Erks Dir

The directory containing all erks for a specific repository.

**Path structure**: `{erks_root}/{repo_name}/`

**Example**: If `erks_root = ~/erks` and repo is named `erk`, then `erks_dir = ~/erks/erk/`

**Contents**:

- Individual erk directories
- `config.toml` (repo-specific configuration)

### Erks Root

The top-level directory containing all managed repositories' erk directories.

**Configuration**: Set in `~/.erk/config.toml`:

```toml
erks_root = "/Users/you/erks"
```

**Structure**:

```
~/erks/                    ← erks root
  ├── erk/                ← erks dir for "erk" repo
  │   ├── feature-a/           ← individual erk
  │   ├── feature-b/           ← individual erk
  │   └── config.toml
  ├── other-project/            ← erks dir for another repo
  │   └── ...
```

### Worktree Path

The absolute path to a specific erk directory.

**Construction**: `{erks_dir}/{worktree_name}`

**Example**: `~/erks/erk/my-feature/`

**Code**: `worktree_path_for(repo.erks_dir, "my-feature")`

### Branch Naming Convention

Erk plan branches follow the pattern `plnd/{slug}-{timestamp}`:

- **plnd/** - Prefix indicating a planned branch
- `{slug}` - Kebab-case description of the work (max 31 chars before timestamp)
- `{timestamp}` - Creation timestamp in `MM-DD-HHMM` format

**Examples**:

- `plnd/add-p-prefix-to-branch-nam-12-09-0934`
- `plnd/fix-auth-bug-01-15-1430`

**Plan-to-branch mapping**: Plan numbers are **not** encoded in branch names. `.erk/impl-context/plan-ref.json` is the sole source of truth for mapping plans to branches.

#### With Objective ID

When a plan is associated with an objective, the branch name includes the objective ID: `plnd/O{objective}-{slug}-{timestamp}`

**Format**:

- **plnd/** - Planned branch prefix
- **O{objective}** - Objective issue number (encoded when `plan.objective_id` is set)
- `{slug}` - Kebab-case description (truncated to fit 31-char limit)
- `{timestamp}` - Creation timestamp in `MM-DD-HHMM` format

**Examples**:

- `plnd/O456-fix-auth-bug-01-15-1430`
- `plnd/O6234-consolidated-do-01-30-1128`

**Extraction**: Use `extract_objective_number(branch_name)` to extract the objective ID from a branch name. Returns `None` for branches without objectives.

**Code**: Generated by `generate_planned_pr_branch_name(title, timestamp, objective_id=obj_id)` in `erk_shared.naming`

### Claude Code Project Directory

The directory where Claude Code stores session data for a specific project. Located at `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>` where the path is encoded by replacing `/` and `.` with `-`.

**Contents**:

- `<session-id>.jsonl` - Main session logs (UUID format)
- `agent-<agent-id>.jsonl` - Subagent logs from Task tool invocations

**Walk-up discovery**: When looking up a project from a working directory, the session store checks if an exact match exists for the current path, then walks up to parent directories until finding a match or hitting the filesystem root. This enables running erk commands from subdirectories of a Claude project.

**See**: [Claude Code Session Layout](sessions/layout.md)

## Path Hierarchy in CLI Commands

When writing CLI commands, use the correct path level for file lookups:

| Path                      | What it represents             | When to use                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ctx.cwd`                 | Where the user ran the command | **Rarely correct** - only for user-relative operations |
| `repo.root` / `repo_root` | Git worktree root              | `.erk/`, `.erk/impl-context/` lookups, git operations  |

### Common Pattern: `.erk/impl-context/` Lookup

`.erk/impl-context/` lives at the worktree root:

```python
impl_context_dir = repo_root / ".erk" / "impl-context"
```

### Common Mistake

**❌ Wrong**: Using `ctx.cwd` for `.erk/impl-context/` lookup

```python
impl_context_dir = ctx.cwd / ".erk" / "impl-context"  # Wrong - user may run from any subdirectory
```

**✅ Correct**: Using worktree root

```python
impl_context_dir = repo_root / ".erk" / "impl-context"
```

---

## Shell Concepts

### Activation Scripts

Shell scripts that change the parent shell's working directory. Used by navigation commands via the `--script` flag.

**Usage**:

```bash
source <(erk up --script)
source <(erk wt co my-worktree --script)
```

**Why needed**: A subprocess cannot change its parent's cwd (Unix process isolation). The `--script` flag outputs a path to an activation script that can be sourced.

---

## Git & Graphite Concepts

**For comprehensive gt documentation**: See [Graphite Branch Setup](erk/graphite-branch-setup.md)

### Force-Push After Squash

When squashing commits on a branch that already has a PR:

1. **Why it's needed**: Squashing rewrites git history, causing the local branch to diverge from remote
2. **Why it's safe**: The PR already exists on remote - you're updating it, not creating it
3. **Pattern**: After `gt squash`, use `gt submit` with `--force` (or equivalent)

This pattern applies to:

- Manual squash + submit workflows
- Any workflow that rewrites history on an existing PR branch

### Trunk Branch

The default branch of the repository (typically `main` or `master`).

The base branch from which all feature branches grow (trunk of the stack tree).

**Detection**: `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`

### Stack

A linear chain of dependent branches managed as worktrees by erk.

**Erk concept**: A stack represents branches that depend on each other, where each branch's changes build on the parent branch. Erk manages these as separate worktrees for parallel development.

**Underlying**: Uses Graphite for branch dependency tracking (`gt` commands).

**Example**:

```
main (trunk)
  └─> feature-a (adds user model)
       └─> feature-a-2 (adds user controller)
            └─> feature-a-3 (adds user views)
```

**Purpose**: Break large features into reviewable chunks while maintaining dependencies, with each branch in its own worktree.

### Default Branch

See: [Trunk Branch](#trunk-branch)

---

## Configuration Terms

### Global Config

Configuration stored in `~/.erk/config.toml`.

**Scope**: Applies to all repositories managed by erk.

**Location**: `~/.erk/config.toml`

**Contents**:

```toml
erks_root = "/Users/you/worktrees"
use_graphite = true
shell_setup_complete = true

prompt_learn_on_land = true  # Set false to disable learn prompts on erk land
```

**Access**: Via `ConfigStore` interface.

### Repo Config

Team-shared configuration stored in the repository.

**Scope**: Applies to all users of the repository.

**Location**: `<repo-root>/.erk/config.toml` (checked into git)

**Contents**:

```toml
[env]
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://localhost/dev_db"

[post_create]
shell = "bash"
commands = ["uv sync"]

[pool]
max_slots = 6

[pool.checkout]
commands = ["git fetch origin"]

[github]
repo = "owner/plans-repo"  # Store plans in separate repo
```

When `[github] repo` is configured, plans are created in the specified repository instead of the current repo. PRs use `Closes owner/plans-repo#N` format to close issues across repositories.

**Access**: Via `load_config(repo_root)` function.

### Local Config

Per-user configuration that overrides repo config.

**Scope**: Personal settings for this user in this repository.

**Location**: `<repo-root>/.erk/config.local.toml` (gitignored)

**Purpose**: Allows individual users to customize their erk experience without affecting other team members. Common uses:

- Different pool sizes (more/fewer worktree slots)
- Custom shell or post-create commands
- Environment variable overrides

**Contents**:

```toml
[pool]
max_slots = 10  # User wants more slots than team default

[env]
MY_CUSTOM_VAR = "value"

[post_create]
shell = "zsh"
commands = ["source ~/.zshrc"]
```

**Merge Semantics** (local overrides repo):

- `env`: Dict merge (local values override repo values)
- `post_create.commands`: Concatenation (repo commands run first, then local)
- `post_create.shell`: Override (local wins if set)
- `pool.max_slots`: Override (local wins if set)
- `github.repo`: Override (local wins if set)

**Access**: Via `load_local_config(repo_root)` + `merge_configs_with_local()`.

**Creation**: `erk init` creates a template `.erk/config.local.toml` with commented examples.

---

## Capability System

### Capability

A feature or functionality that can be installed into a repository managed by erk. Capabilities control which artifacts (skills, workflows, agents, actions) are installed and tracked.

**Types**:

- **Required capabilities** (`required=True`): Always checked by `erk doctor` (e.g., hooks)
- **Optional capabilities**: Only checked if explicitly installed (e.g., skills, workflows)

**Management**:

```bash
erk capability add <name>    # Install a capability
erk capability remove <name> # Uninstall a capability
erk capability list          # Show installed capabilities
```

**Tracking**: Installed capabilities are recorded in `.erk/state.toml` under `[capabilities]`.

**Related**: [Capability System Architecture](architecture/capability-system.md)

### Installed Capabilities

The set of capabilities explicitly installed in a repository, tracked in `.erk/state.toml`.

**Location**: `.erk/state.toml` under `[capabilities]` section

**Format**:

```toml
[capabilities]
installed = ["dignified-python", "erk-impl"]
```

**API** (in `erk.artifacts.state`):

- `add_installed_capability(project_dir, name)` - Record installation
- `remove_installed_capability(project_dir, name)` - Record removal
- `load_installed_capabilities(project_dir)` - Load installed set

**Usage**: `erk doctor` uses this to only check artifacts for installed capabilities.

### installed_capabilities Parameter

A parameter pattern used in artifact health checking to filter which artifacts are checked.

**Values**:

| Value              | Behavior                                         | Use Case                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `None`             | Check ALL artifacts regardless of installation   | Sync, orphan detection, missing files |
| `frozenset({...})` | Check only artifacts from installed capabilities | `erk doctor` health checks            |

**Example**:

```python
# Check ALL artifacts (for sync, orphan detection)
_get_bundled_by_type("skill", installed_capabilities=None)

# Check only installed artifacts (for erk doctor)
installed = load_installed_capabilities(project_dir)
_get_bundled_by_type("skill", installed_capabilities=installed)
```

## Architecture Terms

### Repo Context

A frozen dataclass containing repository information.

**Key Fields**:

- `root: Path` - Working tree root for git commands (worktree or main repo)
- `repo_name: str` - Repository name
- `repo_dir: Path` - Path to erk metadata directory (`~/.erk/repos/<repo-name>`)
- `worktrees_dir: Path` - Path to worktrees directory (`~/.erk/repos/<repo-name>/worktrees`)
- `pool_json_path: Path` - Path to pool state file (`~/.erk/repos/<repo-name>/pool.json`)
- `main_repo_root: Path | None` - Main repository root (defaults to `root` for backwards compatibility)
- `github: GitHubRepoId | None` - GitHub repository identity, if available

**Creation**: `discover_repo_or_sentinel(git, Path.cwd())`

See `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/context/types.py` for the canonical definition (discovery logic in `src/erk/core/repo_discovery.py`).

#### root vs main_repo_root

- **`root`**: The working tree root where git commands should run. For worktrees, this is the worktree directory. For main repos, equals `main_repo_root`.

- **`main_repo_root`**: The main repository root (consistent across all worktrees). Used for:
  - Deriving `repo_name` for metadata paths
  - Operations that need the root worktree (e.g., escaping from a worktree being deleted)
  - Resolving "root" as a target in commands like `stack move root`

**Key insight:** When running from a worktree, git commands use `root` (the worktree), but metadata and escaping use `main_repo_root` (the main repo).

### Erk Context

A frozen dataclass containing all injected dependencies.

**Purpose**: Dependency injection container passed to all commands. Created at CLI entry point and threaded through the application.

**Key Integration Fields**:

- `git: Git` - Git operations (branch ops via `git.branch` subgateway)
- `github: LocalGitHub` - GitHub PR operations (issues via `github.issues` property)
- `github_admin: GitHubAdmin` - GitHub Actions admin operations
- `graphite: Graphite` - Graphite CLI operations
- `graphite_branch_ops: GraphiteBranchOps | None` - None when Graphite disabled
- `console: Console` - TTY detection, user feedback, and confirmation prompts
- `time: Time` - Time abstraction
- `shell: Shell` - Shell detection
- `completion: Completion` - Shell completion generation
- `script_writer: ScriptWriter` - Activation script generation
- `pr_store: ManagedPrBackend` - Plan storage operations
- `prompt_executor: PromptExecutor` - Claude CLI execution

**Configuration Fields**:

- `global_config: GlobalConfig | None` - Global configuration (may be None during init)
- `local_config: LoadedConfig | None` - Merged configuration (repo config + local overrides)
- `dry_run: bool` - Whether to print operations instead of executing

**Path Fields**:

- `cwd: Path` - Current working directory
- `repo: RepoContext | NoRepoSentinel` - Repository context

**Factory Methods**:

- `create_context(dry_run=..., script=..., debug=...)` - Production context with real implementations
- `context_for_test(...)` - Test context with configurable fakes (standalone function, not class method)

See `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/context/context.py` for the canonical definition (re-exported from `src/erk/core/context.py`).

### PRDetails

A frozen dataclass containing comprehensive PR information from a single GitHub API call. Implements the "Fetch Once, Use Everywhere" pattern.

**Location**: `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/github/types.py`

**Related**: [GitHub Interface Patterns](architecture/github-interface-patterns.md)

### PRNotFound

A sentinel class returned when a PR lookup fails, preserving lookup context (branch name, PR number). Uses `isinstance` check (LBYL) instead of exceptions.

**Location**: `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/github/types.py`

**Related**: [Not-Found Sentinel Pattern](architecture/not-found-sentinel.md)

---

## Event Types

### ProgressEvent

A frozen dataclass for emitting progress notifications during long-running operations.

**Location**: `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/gt/events.py`

**Purpose**: Decouple progress reporting from rendering. Operations yield events; CLI layer renders them.

**Fields**:

- `message: str` - Human-readable progress message
- `style: Literal["info", "success", "warning", "error"]` - Visual style hint (default: "info")

**Example**:

```python
yield ProgressEvent("Analyzing changes with Claude...")
yield ProgressEvent("Complete", style="success")
```

**Related**: [Claude CLI Progress Feedback Pattern](architecture/claude-cli-progress.md)

### CompletionEvent

A generic frozen dataclass wrapping the final result of a generator-based operation.

**Location**: `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/gt/events.py`

**Purpose**: Signal operation completion and provide the result to the consumer.

**Type Parameter**: `CompletionEvent[T]` where `T` is the result type.

**Example**:

```python
yield CompletionEvent(MyResult(success=True, data=data))
```

**Related**: [Claude CLI Progress Feedback Pattern](architecture/claude-cli-progress.md)

### ExecutorEvent

A discriminated union of frozen dataclasses representing events from Claude CLI streaming execution. Consumed via pattern matching.

**Location**: `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/core/prompt_executor.py`

**Related**: [Prompt Executor Gateway](architecture/prompt-executor-gateway.md), [Claude CLI Integration](architecture/claude-cli-integration.md)

---

## Gateway Terms

### Dual-Source Pattern

A pattern where both Graphite's local cache AND GitHub's API are queried to ensure completeness. Used when Graphite's cache may be incomplete (e.g., branches created outside `gt` commands).

**Why needed**: Graphite only tracks branches created via `gt branch create`. Branches created through `git branch`, `gh pr create`, or where the PR base was changed in GitHub are invisible to Graphite's cache.

**Example**: `land_pr.py` queries both `graphite.get_child_branches()` and `github.get_open_prs_with_base_branch()` to find ALL child branches before landing, preventing child PRs from being auto-closed.

**Pattern**:

```python
graphite_children = ops.graphite.get_child_branches(...)
github_children = [pr.head_branch for pr in ops.github.get_open_prs_with_base_branch(...)]
all_children = list(set(graphite_children) | set(github_children))
```

**See**: [Gateway Hierarchy](architecture/gateway-hierarchy.md#dual-source-patterns-graphite--github)

### Gateway

An ABC (Abstract Base Class) defining an interface for an external system (Git, LocalGitHub, Graphite, etc.). Each gateway has an implementation pattern: `abc.py`, `real.py`, `fake.py` (3-file default), plus `dry_run.py` for dry-run-enabled gateways (4-file).

**Related**: [Gateway ABC Implementation](architecture/gateway-abc-implementation.md), [Gateway Inventory](architecture/gateway-inventory.md)

### Real Implementation

Production implementation of a gateway (`Real<Interface>`, e.g., `RealGit`). Instantiated in `create_context()`.

### Fake Implementation

In-memory test implementation (`Fake<Interface>`, e.g., `FakeGit`). All state via constructor, no public setup methods. Located in `tests/fakes/`.

### Dry Run Wrapper

Wraps real implementation, prints messages instead of executing destructive operations (`DryRun<Interface>`, e.g., `DryRunGit`). Used when `--dry-run` flag is passed.

---

## Command-Specific Terms

### Plan Folder

A `.erk/impl-context/` folder containing implementation plans and progress tracking for a feature.

**Usage**: `erk create --from-plan-file my-plan.md my-feature`

**Behavior**:

- Plan file is converted to `.erk/impl-context/` folder structure in the new worktree
- Contains two files:
  - `plan.md` - Immutable implementation plan
  - `progress.md` - Mutable progress tracking with checkboxes
- `.erk/impl-context/` is gitignored (not committed)
- Useful for keeping implementation notes with the working code

**Benefits**:

- Separation of concerns: plan content vs progress tracking
- No risk of corrupting plan while updating progress
- Progress visible in `erk status` output

**Example**:

```bash
# Create plan
echo "## Implementation Plan\n1. Step 1\n2. Step 2" > plan.md

# Create worktree from plan file
erk create --from-plan-file plan.md my-feature

# Plan structure created:
# ~/erks/erk/my-feature/.erk/impl-context/
#   ├── plan.md        (immutable)
#   └── progress.md    (mutable, with checkboxes)
```

**Legacy Format**: Old worktrees may still use `.PLAN.md` single-file format. These will continue to work but won't show progress tracking.

### Dry Run

Mode where commands print what they would do without executing destructive operations.

**Activation**: `--dry-run` flag on commands

**Behavior**:

- Read-only operations execute normally
- Destructive operations print messages prefixed with `[DRY RUN]`

**Example**:

```bash
erk delete my-feature --dry-run
# Output: [DRY RUN] Would delete worktree: /Users/you/worktrees/erk/my-feature
```

---

## Documentation System

### Front Matter

YAML metadata block at the beginning of agent documentation files.

**Required fields**:

- `title`: Human-readable document title
- `read_when`: List of conditions when agents should read this doc

**Optional fields**:

- `tripwires`: List of action-triggered warnings

**Example**:

```yaml
---
title: Scratch Storage
read_when:
  - "writing temp files for AI workflows"
tripwires:
  - action: "writing to /tmp/"
    warning: "Use .erk/scratch/<session-id>/ instead."
---
```

### read_when

A front matter field listing conditions that trigger documentation routing.

**Purpose**: Powers the agent documentation index. When an agent's task matches a `read_when` condition, the index routes them to the relevant doc.

**Distinction from tripwires**:

- `read_when` = Agent actively searches for guidance (pull model)
- `tripwires` = Agent is about to perform action (push model)

**Example**:

```yaml
read_when:
  - "creating a plan"
  - "closing a plan"
```

### Tripwire

An action-triggered rule that routes agents to documentation when specific behavior patterns are detected.

**Format**: Defined in doc frontmatter with `action` (pattern to detect) and `warning` (guidance message).

**Purpose**: Catches agents _before_ they make mistakes, complementing the `read_when` index which requires agents to actively seek guidance.

**Example**:

```yaml
tripwires:
  - action: "writing to /tmp/"
    warning: "AI workflow files belong in .erk/scratch/<session-id>/, NOT /tmp/."
```

**See also**: [Tripwires System](commands/tripwires.md)

---

## Testing Terms

### Isolated Filesystem

A temporary directory created by Click's test runner for unit tests.

**Usage**:

```python
runner = CliRunner()
with runner.isolated_filesystem():
    # Operations here happen in temporary directory
    # Automatically cleaned up after test
```

**Purpose**: Prevent tests from affecting actual filesystem.

### Integration Test

Test that uses real implementations and filesystem operations.

**Location**: `tests/integration/`

**Characteristics**:

- Uses `RealGit`, actual git commands
- Slower than unit tests
- Tests real integration with external tools

**Example**: `tests/integration/test_git_integration.py`

### Unit Test

Test that uses fake implementations and isolated filesystem.

**Location**: `tests/commands/`, `tests/core/`

**Characteristics**:

- Uses `FakeGit`, `FakeLocalGitHub`, etc.
- Fast (no subprocess calls)
- Majority of test suite

**Example**: `tests/commands/test_rm.py`

---

## Plan & Extraction Concepts

### Learn Plan

A special type of implementation plan created by `/erk:learn`. Learn plans capture documentation improvements and learnings discovered during implementation sessions.

**Characteristics**:

- Labeled with `erk-pr` (like all plans)
- **Issue identification**: Issues have the `erk-learn` label (in addition to `erk-pr`)
- Created from session analysis to capture valuable insights
- Contains documentation items rather than code changes
- Marked with `plan_type: learn` in the plan-header metadata
- PRs from learn plans receive the `erk-skip-learn` label

**Identifying Learn Plans in Code**:

- Label: Check for `erk-learn` in the plan's labels
- Helper function: `is_issue_learn_plan(labels)` in `src/erk/cli/commands/pr/dispatch_cmd.py`
- Plan metadata: Check `plan_type: learn` in plan-header
- PR label: PRs from learn plans have `erk-skip-extraction`

**Special Behaviors**:

- `erk land` skips the "not learned from" warning for learn plans (they don't need learning)
- `/erk:learn` validates the plan has the `erk-learn` label

**Purpose**: Prevent valuable learnings from being lost after implementation sessions by systematically documenting patterns, decisions, and discoveries.

**Related**: [erk-skip-learn](#erk-skip-learn), [Plan Lifecycle](planning/lifecycle.md)

### erk-skip-learn

A GitHub label added to PRs that originate from learn plans. When `erk land` detects this label, it automatically skips creating the pending-learn marker and deletes the worktree immediately.

**Purpose**: Prevents infinite extraction loops where extracting insights from a learn-originated PR would lead to another learn plan.

**Applied by**:

- `erk pr dispatch` when the source plan has `plan_type: learn`
- `gt finalize` when the `.erk/impl-context/plan.md` has `plan_type: learn`

**Checked by**:

- `erk land` - Skips insight extraction if label present

**Design Decision**: Labels are used instead of PR body markers because:

1. **Visibility** - Labels are visible in GitHub UI, making learn PRs easy to identify
2. **Simplicity** - Label checks are simpler than parsing PR body content
3. **Separation** - PR body remains focused on the actual PR description
4. **Flexibility** - Labels can be manually added/removed for edge cases

**Related**: [Learn Plan](#learn-plan), [pending-learn](#pending-learn), [Learn Origin Tracking](architecture/learn-origin-tracking.md)

### erk-consolidated

A GitHub label added to plans created by consolidating multiple learn plans. Prevents re-consolidation by `/local:replan-learn-plans`.

**Purpose**: State machine marker that stops the consolidation workflow from picking up its own output.

**Applied by**:

- `/erk:replan` when operating in consolidation mode (multiple source plans)

**Checked by**:

- `/local:replan-learn-plans` - Filters out plans with this label before consolidation

**Lifecycle**:

1. Multiple `erk-learn` plans exist
2. `/local:replan-learn-plans` consolidates them into single new plan
3. New plan gets both `erk-learn` and `erk-consolidated` labels
4. Original plans are closed with reference to new one
5. Future consolidation runs skip the `erk-consolidated` plan

**Related**: [Consolidation Labels](planning/consolidation-labels.md), [Learn Plan](#learn-plan)

### pending-learn

A marker state indicating a merged PR is queued for insight extraction. When `erk land` completes successfully (and the PR is not from a learn plan), it leaves the worktree in a "pending learn" state for later session analysis.

**Purpose**: Queue merged PRs for documentation extraction to capture learnings.

**Lifecycle**:

1. PR merges via `erk land`
2. If not learn-originated → worktree marked as pending-learn
3. User runs learn workflow later to capture insights
4. Worktree deleted after learning complete

**Skip condition**: PRs with `erk-skip-learn` label bypass this marking.

### Session Branch Fields

Plan-header metadata fields for tracking pushed session logs. Sessions are accumulated on `planned-pr-context/{pr_number}` branches.

**Fields:**

| Field                 | Type                        | Description                                                                               |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `last_session_branch` | string \| null              | Branch containing accumulated preprocessed session XMLs                                   |
| `last_session_id`     | string \| null              | Claude Code session ID of the last pushed session                                         |
| `last_session_at`     | string \| null              | ISO 8601 timestamp of when the session was pushed                                         |
| `last_session_source` | "local" \| "remote" \| null | Where the session originated - "local" for developer machine, "remote" for GitHub Actions |

**Usage:**

These fields are set by:

- `erk exec push-session` - Pushes preprocessed session to learn branch and updates plan-header
- GitHub Actions workflow (`plan-implement.yml`) - Automatically pushes session after remote implementation

These fields are read by:

- `erk exec get-learn-sessions` - Returns session sources with `preprocessed_manifest` for download
- `/erk:learn` command - Uses branch reference to download remote sessions for analysis

## Streaming & Execution Terms

### Bypass PR Commands (Historical)

A set of now-removed commands (`pr-prep`, `pr-update`, `prepare-local`) that allowed preparing PR branches locally without GitHub CLI. Removed in favor of the streamlined `gt` workflow.

### Streaming Subprocess

An execution pattern where subprocess output is streamed to the UI in real-time via background threads and cross-thread callbacks.

**Key components**:

- Background thread reads subprocess stdout
- `app.call_from_thread()` safely updates UI from background thread
- Event queue buffers parsed output

**Related**: [TUI Streaming Output Patterns](tui/streaming-output.md)

### PromptExecutor

The core ABC for launching Claude CLI in various modes (interactive, streaming, command, prompt).

**Location**: `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/core/prompt_executor.py`

**Related**: [Prompt Executor Gateway](architecture/prompt-executor-gateway.md)

### ClaudePromptExecutor

The real implementation of PromptExecutor. Launches the actual Claude CLI binary.

**Location**: `src/erk/core/prompt_executor.py`

### FakePromptExecutor

The test fake for PromptExecutor. Constructor injection for all behaviors, tracks all calls.

**Location**: `tests/fakes/prompt_executor.py`

**Related**: [Prompt Executor Gateway](architecture/prompt-executor-gateway.md)

### Capability Marker

A parameter (like `repo_root`) whose presence/absence determines which execution path or feature set is available. Used to gracefully degrade functionality.

**Example**: `PlanDetailScreen` uses `repo_root` to decide whether streaming execution is available or commands are disabled.

**Related**: [Command Execution Strategies](tui/command-execution.md)

## Objectives System

The objectives system enables incremental, bounded progress toward long-running goals. Objectives act as "plan factories" - they generate focused implementation plans rather than being implemented directly.

### Objective

A long-running goal that produces bounded plans when evaluated against the codebase.

**Purpose**: Break large, complex goals into reviewable, implementable chunks. Instead of tackling "migrate all errors to Ensure class" in one massive PR, an objective evaluates the codebase, identifies a manageable subset of violations, and creates a plan for that subset.

**Storage**: `.erk/objectives/<name>/`

### Turn

A single evaluation cycle where Claude assesses current state against the objective's desired state.

**Output**: Either `STATUS: COMPLETE` (objective fully achieved) or `STATUS: GAPS_FOUND` (work remaining).

**Mechanism**:

1. Claude receives objective definition + accumulated notes + codebase access
2. Evaluates current state vs desired state
3. Reports status with optional gap description
4. If gaps found, creates bounded implementation plan

**CLI**: `erk objective plan <objective-name>`
