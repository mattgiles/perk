# Refactoring Tripwires

Rules triggered by matching actions in code.

**completing a libcst-refactor batch rename** → Read [LibCST Systematic Import Refactoring](libcst-systematic-imports.md) first. After bulk rename, grep entire codebase for old symbol name. LibCST leave_Name visitor does NOT rename string literals used as dict keys. Subagent may miss files outside its scope.

**completing a refactoring without searching docs/learned/ for stale references** → Read [Post-Refactoring Documentation Audit](post-refactor-documentation-audit.md) first. 64% of review violations come from stale documentation after refactoring. Run the 5-step checklist in post-refactor-documentation-audit.md before marking the task complete.

**completing a rename without checking serialization names** → Read [Systematic Rename Checklist](systematic-rename-checklist.md) first. Serialization names (JSON keys, provider names, YAML values) may need to be preserved for backward compatibility even when code identifiers change. Check all serialization points.

**completing a terminology rename without grepping for string literals** → Read [Systematic Terminology Renames](systematic-terminology-renames.md) first. LibCST leave_Name visitor does NOT rename string literals used as dict keys. After LibCST batch rename, grep for old identifier as string key.

**interleaving file moves and import updates** → Read [LibCST Systematic Import Refactoring](libcst-systematic-imports.md) first. Move ALL files first (git mv), THEN batch-update ALL imports. Interleaving creates intermediate broken states. See gateway-consolidation-checklist.md.

**manually updating imports across 10+ files** → Read [LibCST Systematic Import Refactoring](libcst-systematic-imports.md) first. Use LibCST via the libcst-refactor agent or a one-off script. Manual editing misses call sites and creates partial migration states.

**removing a feature without checking all artifact categories** → Read [Feature Removal Checklist](feature-removal-checklist.md) first. Feature removal leaves scattered artifacts. Use this checklist to verify complete removal across source code, tests, constants, documentation, workflows, CLI commands, and glossary entries.

**renaming a Python package without checking all entry points** → Read [Python Package Rename Checklist](python-package-rename-checklist.md) first. Package renames require updating pyproject.toml scripts, Makefile targets, CI config, and documentation. Use the checklist in python-package-rename-checklist.md.

**renaming a command or concept across the codebase** → Read [Coordinated Cross-Codebase Rename Pattern](coordinated-rename.md) first. Follow the 12-point checklist in coordinated-rename.md. Renames typically touch 13-15 files across CLI/TUI/tests/docs/skills. Missing any site causes runtime errors or stale references.

**renaming display strings without checking test assertions** → Read [Systematic Terminology Renames](systematic-terminology-renames.md) first. After display-string renames, search test assertions: `grep -r '"old_term"' tests/`. Not caught by linters or type checkers.

**running targeted edits after replace_all operations in the same file** → Read [LibCST Systematic Import Refactoring](libcst-systematic-imports.md) first. During type migrations, complete all rename operations before attempting targeted edits. replace_all operations change strings that later edits expect to find.

**using replace_all on lines with trailing comments** → Read [LibCST Systematic Import Refactoring](libcst-systematic-imports.md) first. Edit tool's replace_all removes surrounding whitespace, which can collapse lines and cause SyntaxError.

**using replace_all to rename foo to \_foo** → Read [LibCST Systematic Import Refactoring](libcst-systematic-imports.md) first. Corrupts existing \_foo to \_\_foo. Grep for existing underscored forms before applying replace_all renames.

**verifying a CLI entry point with --help without checking if it uses Click or argparse** → Read [Python Package Rename Checklist](python-package-rename-checklist.md) first. Check whether the CLI uses Click or argparse before running --help. Click commands print help and exit 0; argparse may behave differently. For uv-managed packages, use 'uv run <name> --help'.

**writing LibCST transformation logic from scratch** → Read [LibCST Systematic Import Refactoring](libcst-systematic-imports.md) first. The libcst-refactor agent (.claude/agents/libcst-refactor.md) contains battle-tested patterns, gotchas, and a script template. Load it first.
