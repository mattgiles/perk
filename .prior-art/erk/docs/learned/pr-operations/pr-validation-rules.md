# PR Validation Rules

`erk pr check` enforces structural invariants on every PR: a checkout footer containing the correct PR number. Understanding **why** these checks exist and **where** the data comes from prevents the most common agent mistakes.

## The Checks

<!-- Source: src/erk/cli/commands/pr/check_cmd.py, pr_check -->

See `pr_check()` in `src/erk/cli/commands/pr/check_cmd.py` for the orchestration logic. The command runs checks in sequence:

| Check             | What it validates                                                     | Why it exists                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Plan-ref presence | `.erk/impl-context/plan-ref.json` exists and contains a valid plan ID | Confirms the PR is linked to a tracked plan           |
| Checkout footer   | PR body contains `erk pr checkout <pr_number>` with exact number      | Lets reviewers check out the PR into a fresh worktree |
| Header position   | Plan-header metadata is at bottom, not legacy top position            | Ensures PR body follows current formatting standards  |

## The PR Number vs Issue Number Trap

This is the single most common validation failure for agents, and it stems from a data source confusion:

| Data source                       | Contains      | Use for                                    |
| --------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `.erk/impl-context/plan-ref.json` | Plan number   | Identifying the plan (not used in PR body) |
| `create_pr()` return value        | **PR** number | `erk pr checkout N` footer                 |

**Why agents get confused:** During the submit workflow, `.erk/impl-context/plan-ref.json` is readily available and contains a number. The checkout footer needs a number. Agents grab the accessible one — but it's the wrong one. The PR number doesn't exist until `create_pr()` returns.

## Validation Matching Details

<!-- Source: packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/pr/submit.py, has_checkout_footer_for_pr -->

The `has_checkout_footer_for_pr()` function (in `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/pr/submit.py`) uses regex with word boundaries (`\b`) to prevent partial number matches — PR #12 won't falsely match a footer containing `erk pr checkout 123`.

There is also a less strict `has_body_footer()` function that only checks for the presence of _any_ `erk pr checkout` string without validating the number. This is used during PR creation to detect whether a footer already exists, while the stricter per-number check is used during validation.

## Debugging Validation Failures

When `erk pr check` fails, the resolution pattern is:

1. Read the specific validation function to understand the exact regex
2. Compare the regex against the actual PR body content
3. Fix the mismatch (usually a wrong number or missing footer)

Common failure modes:

- **"PR body missing checkout footer"** — Footer was never appended, or uses wrong PR number
- **Missing plan reference** — `.erk/impl-context/plan-ref.json` is absent or unreadable

## Stage-Specific Checks

### `--stage=impl`

When `erk pr check --stage=impl` is run, an additional validation check is included:

| Check                        | What it validates                    | Why it exists                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.erk/impl-context/` cleanup | Directory must not exist in the repo | Transient artifacts cause CI formatter failures (Prettier) |

This check verifies that the `.erk/impl-context/` folder was properly removed after implementation.

**Source:** `src/erk/cli/commands/pr/check_cmd.py` — the `--stage` option accepts `click.Choice(["impl"])`.
