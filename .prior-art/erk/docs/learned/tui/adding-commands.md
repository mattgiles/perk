# Adding Commands to TUI

## Architecture: The Dual-Handler Pattern

Commands follow a **dual-handler pattern**:

1. **Registry** (`src/erk/tui/commands/registry.py`) — Defines `CommandDefinition` with metadata and availability predicates
2. **Handlers** — Implement actual logic in two locations:
   - `ErkDashApp.execute_palette_command()` in `app.py` — Main list context
   - `PlanDetailScreen.execute_command()` — Detail modal context

Commands need different behavior depending on invocation context. See the actual source files for current command definitions and handler implementations.

## Adding a New Command

1. **Add `CommandDefinition`** to `registry.py` with id, name, description, category, shortcut, availability predicate
2. **Add handler** in `ErkDashApp.execute_palette_command()` for main list context
3. **Add handler** in `PlanDetailScreen.execute_command()` for detail modal context
4. **Add registry tests** in `tests/tui/commands/test_registry.py`

## Command Categories

| Category | Emoji     | Use For                                     |
| -------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `ACTION` | lightning | Mutative operations (close, dispatch, land) |
| `OPEN`   | link      | Browser navigation (open issue, PR, run)    |
| `COPY`   | clipboard | Clipboard operations (copy commands)        |

## Three-Layer Null Validation

Commands that depend on optional `PlanRowData` fields require three-layer validation:

### Layer 1: Registry Availability Predicate

Controls whether the command appears in the palette. Necessary but not sufficient.

### Layer 2: Handler Guard Check

The handler must validate again before using optional fields. Handlers can be invoked through keyboard shortcuts or programmatic paths that bypass the palette.

### Layer 3: App-Level Helper (Optional)

For complex commands, extract validation into a helper that encapsulates all guards and fallback chains.

**Why three layers?**

- Registry predicates can become stale if data changes between palette open and execution
- Keyboard shortcuts may bypass the palette entirely
- Python type narrowing doesn't persist across method boundaries

## Remote Workflow Commands

Remote commands dispatch GitHub Actions workflows instead of executing locally. They use streaming subprocess to show dispatch status and workflow URL, but make no local modifications.

| Aspect        | Local Streaming        | Remote Workflow                      |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Execution     | Runs in subprocess     | Triggers GitHub Actions              |
| Duration      | Full command time      | Only dispatch time                   |
| Output        | Command output         | Dispatch confirmation + workflow URL |
| State changes | May modify local files | No local modifications               |

## Provider Context: `pr_backend` Field

`CommandContext` has three fields: `row`, `view_mode`, and `pr_backend`. The `pr_backend` field enables backend-specific command filtering.

**Wiring in `MainListCommandProvider`**: Reads the active backend type from the app context and passes it to `CommandContext`. Commands filtered by `_is_github_backend(ctx)` use this field.

**Wiring in `PlanCommandProvider`**: Also passes `pr_backend` through. Since the detail modal can be opened from either backend, backend-aware commands need the field here too.

For backend-specific command filtering, see [Backend-Aware Commands](backend-aware-commands.md).
