# TUI Command Architecture

The TUI command system uses a data-driven registry pattern where commands declare their own availability based on `PlanRowData` field presence. This decouples command definitions from UI rendering, enabling the same registry to serve multiple frontends (TUI command palette, desktop toolbar).

## Why Data-Driven Availability

<!-- Source: src/erk/tui/commands/registry.py, get_all_commands -->

Commands don't check "can I run?" at execution time — they declare upfront what data they need via `is_available` predicates. This design was chosen because:

1. **Multiple consumers need the same logic.** The TUI command palette (`MainListCommandProvider`, `PlanCommandProvider`) and the desktop dashboard toolbar both need to know which actions are valid for a given row. Centralizing predicates in the registry avoids duplicating availability logic across frontends.

2. **Availability depends on `PlanRowData` nullability.** Each `PlanRowData` field is nullable for a reason (no PR yet, no workflow run, etc.). The predicates express which combination of non-null fields a command requires. This makes the availability contract explicit and testable.

3. **Commands that are always available use `lambda _: True`** — these are plan-level operations (close, prepare, dispatch) that only need the issue number, which is always present.

## Category-to-Execution Pattern Mapping

Categories are not just cosmetic labels — they correlate strongly with execution characteristics:

| Category | Execution Pattern                       | Latency    | Side Effects                               |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| ACTION   | In-process HTTP or subprocess streaming | 500ms–600s | Mutates GitHub state or triggers workflows |
| OPEN     | Browser launch                          | Instant    | None (navigates browser)                   |
| COPY     | Clipboard write                         | Instant    | None (copies to clipboard)                 |

The key insight is within ACTION: some actions (close, dispatch) are fast in-process HTTP calls to the GitHub API, while others (land, rebase, address) are long-running subprocess commands with streaming output. The distinction matters because streaming commands need the `repo_root` capability marker and the full cross-thread UI update pipeline described in [streaming-output.md](streaming-output.md).

## Availability Predicate Patterns

<!-- Source: src/erk/tui/commands/registry.py, get_all_commands -->

Commands fall into four availability tiers:

| Tier               | Predicate                     | Commands                                                       | Rationale                                                     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Always available   | `lambda _: True`              | close_plan, copy_prepare, copy_prepare_activate, copy_dispatch | Only need `plan_id`, which is always present                  |
| Needs plan URL     | `plan_url is not None`        | dispatch_to_queue, copy_replan, open_issue                     | Requires the plan to exist on GitHub (not just locally)       |
| Needs local branch | `worktree_branch is not None` | copy_checkout                                                  | Local worktree branch must exist to generate checkout command |
| Needs PR           | `pr_number is not None`       | rebase_remote, address_remote, open_pr, copy_pr_checkout       | PR must be linked to the plan                                 |
| Compound condition | Multiple fields non-null      | land_pr (needs PR + OPEN state + run URL)                      | Landing requires all CI infrastructure to be present          |

**Anti-pattern**: Writing `is_available=lambda ctx: True` for a command that uses `ctx.row.pr_number`. The predicate will allow execution when `pr_number` is None, causing a runtime error. This is why the [three-layer null validation](adding-commands.md) pattern exists — the predicate is necessary but not sufficient.

## Objective Commands

<!-- Source: src/erk/tui/commands/registry.py, get_all_commands -->

Seven commands are registered for the Objectives view, spanning all three categories:

| ID                   | Name               | Category | Shortcut | Availability              |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | -------- | -------- | ------------------------- |
| `one_shot_plan`      | Plan (One-Shot)    | ACTION   | `s`      | Objectives view           |
| `check_objective`    | Check Objective    | ACTION   | `5`      | Objectives view           |
| `close_objective`    | Close Objective    | ACTION   | —        | Objectives view           |
| `open_objective`     | Objective          | OPEN     | `p`      | Objectives view + has URL |
| `copy_plan`          | erk objective plan | COPY     | `1`      | Objectives view           |
| `copy_view`          | erk objective view | COPY     | `3`      | Objectives view           |
| `codespace_run_plan` | Codespace Run Plan | COPY     | —        | Objectives view           |

Objective commands use `_is_objectives_view(ctx)` as their view predicate, ensuring they only appear when the Objectives tab is active. Shortcuts are safely reused from plan commands because the view predicates guarantee mutual exclusivity. See [View-Aware Command Filtering](view-aware-commands.md) for the full filtering mechanism.

## Key Binding: view_comments

<!-- Source: src/erk/tui/app.py, ErkApp.action_view_comments -->

The `view_comments` action (`c` key) opens a modal screen displaying unresolved PR review comments. It follows the three-layer LBYL guard pattern before launching the modal. See `ErkApp.action_view_comments()` in `src/erk/tui/app.py` for the implementation.

The guard pattern checks data availability at each level (row exists, PR exists, comments exist) before attempting the operation, with status bar messages for expected empty states.
