# Tui Tripwires

Rules triggered by matching actions in code.

**accessing \_status_bar without null guard** → Read [TUI Streaming Output Patterns](streaming-output.md) first. Guard \_status_bar access with `if self._status_bar is not None:` — timing issue during widget lifecycle can cause AttributeError.

**accessing optional gateway fields without null checks in TUI event handlers** → Read [Modal Widget Embedding Pattern](modal-widget-embedding.md) first. Gateway fields like plan_body or objective_content may be None. Always check before accessing in event handlers.

**adding CI check formatting to TUI screens** → Read [TUI Architecture Overview](architecture.md) first. Use src/erk/tui/formatting/ci_checks.py shared module (format_check_line, format_summary_blockquote, format_check_runs) instead of duplicating formatting logic.

**adding a CLI flag that affects behavior without checking TUI command palette** → Read [TUI Command Registration](tui-command-registration.md) first. TUI command palette generates shell commands via src/erk/tui/commands/registry.py. When adding CLI flags that change behavior, check if TUI-generated commands need the flag too.

**adding a DataTable column with add_column(key=...)** → Read [TUI Architecture Overview](architecture.md) first. Column key is a data binding contract — must match data field name. Silent failure when mismatched.

**adding a column to PlanDataTable without updating make_plan_row** → Read [Column Addition Pattern](column-addition-pattern.md) first. Column additions require 5 coordinated changes. See column-addition-pattern.md for the complete checklist.

**adding a command without an availability predicate** → Read [TUI Command Architecture](action-inventory.md) first. Every command needs an is_available predicate based on PlanRowData field presence. Commands without predicates appear when they can't execute.

**adding a field to PlanRowData without updating make_plan_row** → Read [TUI Data Contract](data-contract.md) first. The fake's make_plan_row() helper must stay in sync. Add the new field with a sensible default there too, or all TUI tests will break.

**adding a filter toggle to the TUI dashboard** → Read [TUI Filter Toggle Pattern](filter-toggle-pattern.md) first. Server-side filters (like author) must clear \_data_cache on toggle. Client-side filters (like stack, objective) only re-filter cached rows. Follow the 6-component pattern in filter-toggle-pattern.md.

**adding a new TUI command without updating all 3 places** → Read [TUI Command Registration](tui-command-registration.md) first. TUI commands require 3-place coordination: registry definition, display formatter, and action inventory. See tui-command-registration.md.

**adding a new ViewMode without updating VIEW_CONFIGS** → Read [TUI View Switching](view-switching.md) first. Every ViewMode must have a corresponding ViewConfig in VIEW_CONFIGS. Missing configs cause KeyError at runtime.

**adding a new column to RunDataTable without updating RunRowData** → Read [Runs Tab Architecture](runs-tab-architecture.md) first. RunDataTable columns are populated from RunRowData fields. Add the field to RunRowData first, then add the column in \_setup_columns.

**adding a new filter without updating the escape chain** → Read [TUI Filter Pipeline Pattern](filter-pipeline.md) first. New filter implementations must add an entry to `action_exit_app()` progressive escape chain. Missing entries leave filters stuck with no way for the user to clear them.

**adding a new key binding without checking existing bindings** → Read [TUI Keyboard Shortcuts Inventory](keyboard-shortcuts.md) first. Check this document and ErkDashApp.BINDINGS in app.py for conflicts. Some keys are hidden but still active.

**adding a new lifecycle stage without updating abbreviation map** → Read [Lifecycle and PR Status Display](lifecycle-display.md) first. The stage column is 8 chars wide. New stages longer than 8 chars need abbreviations in compute_lifecycle_display(). Also update format_lifecycle_with_status() stage detection.

**adding a subprocess call to the TUI without stderr inspection** → Read [TUI Subprocess Feedback Patterns](subprocess-feedback.md) first. TUI subprocess calls should inspect stderr for known success/failure markers. See subprocess-feedback.md for the pattern.

**adding an ACTION command that executes instantly** → Read [TUI Command Architecture](action-inventory.md) first. ACTION category implies mutative operations. Instant operations belong in OPEN or COPY categories.

**adding emoji with Unicode variation selector (\ufe0f) to status indicators** → Read [TUI Status Indicators](status-indicators.md) first. Variation selector forces double-wide rendering in terminals, breaking column alignment. Current safe emoji: 🥞 🚧 👀 💥 ✔ ❌ 🚀. Test any new emoji in terminal before adding.

**adding labels to ViewConfig.labels expecting OR semantics from GitHub API** → Read [TUI View Switching](view-switching.md) first. GitHub GraphQL uses AND semantics for label arrays. Multiple labels in a single ViewConfig.labels means items must have ALL listed labels. Use separate views for separate label types. See github-graphql-label-semantics.md.

**adding or reordering PlanDataTable columns** → Read [Column Addition Pattern](column-addition-pattern.md) first. TUI column index cascade: adding or reordering columns invalidates ALL test assertions using column indices. Run a systematic grep for column-index assertions (e.g., row[N]) before and after the change. Update every affected test file.

**adding stage column outside planned_pr backend check** → Read [Dashboard Column Inventory](dashboard-columns.md) first. stage column is planned_pr-only. It appears before obj in the column order. Check \_setup_columns() for the backend conditional block.

**adding streaming commands without using the streaming operation pattern** → Read [View-Aware Command Filtering](view-aware-commands.md) first. Streaming ACTION commands need the streaming operation wrapper with status bar tracking. See streaming-output.md for the current pattern.

**adding the same label to multiple ViewConfig entries without exclude_labels** → Read [TUI View Switching](view-switching.md) first. Without exclude_labels, items matching the shared label appear in multiple views. Use exclude_labels for defense-in-depth deduplication (Plans view excludes erk-learn).

**caching fetched data under self.\_view_mode after an async operation** → Read [TUI Async State Snapshot Pattern](async-state-snapshot.md) first. Cache under fetched_mode (snapshot at start), not self.\_view_mode (may have changed during fetch).

**calling self.notify() or self.\_finish_operation() directly from a background thread** → Read [TUI Multi-Operation Tracking](multi-operation-tracking.md) first. Use self.call_from_thread() for all UI updates from @work(thread=True) methods. Direct calls cause thread-safety violations.

**calling start_operation() without a matching finish_operation() in the error path** → Read [TUI Multi-Operation Tracking](multi-operation-tracking.md) first. Always call finish_operation() in both success and error paths. Use try/finally or explicit error handling. Missing finish calls leave ghost operations in the status bar.

**calling widget methods directly from @work(thread=True) background threads** → Read [TUI Architecture Overview](architecture.md) first. Direct widget calls from background threads cause silent UI corruption. Must use self.app.call_from_thread(callback, ...).

**calling widget methods from @work(thread=True) without call_from_thread()** → Read [TUI Modal Screen Pattern](modal-screen-pattern.md) first. Background thread widget mutations cause silent UI corruption. Use self.app.call_from_thread(callback, ...).

**changing filter application order in \_apply_filter_and_sort()** → Read [TUI Filter Pipeline Pattern](filter-pipeline.md) first. Filter order is intentional: objective → stack → text → sort. Objective is broadest (cross-stack), stack is mid-level, text is narrowest. Changing order produces unexpected results.

**completing a background worker thread without calling action_refresh** → Read [Async Action Refresh Pattern](async-action-refresh-pattern.md) first. Always call_from_thread(self.action_refresh) after successful background work to update the TUI display.

**constructing PlanFilters without copying all fields from existing filters** → Read [TUI Data Contract](data-contract.md) first. All fields must be explicitly copied in \_load_data() PlanFilters construction. Missing fields (like creator) cause silent filtering failures.

**constructing op IDs without the {action}-{resource}-{id} pattern** → Read [TUI Multi-Operation Tracking](multi-operation-tracking.md) first. Op IDs must follow the convention: f'{action}-{resource_type}-{resource_id}' (e.g., 'land-pr-456', 'close-plan-123'). Non-unique IDs cause operations to overwrite each other.

**creating a ModalScreen without CSS for dismiss behavior** → Read [TUI Modal Screen Pattern](modal-screen-pattern.md) first. ModalScreen requires explicit CSS for the overlay. Without it, clicking outside the modal does nothing.

**displaying subprocess output in plain text widgets without stripping ANSI** → Read [TUI Streaming Output Patterns](streaming-output.md) first. Use click.unstyle() before displaying subprocess output in plain text widgets. Raw ANSI codes render as garbage.

**duplicating command definitions for list and detail contexts** → Read [Dual Provider Pattern for Context-Agnostic Commands](dual-handler-pattern.md) first. Commands are defined once in the registry. Use a second Provider subclass with its own \_get_context() to serve the same commands from a new context.

**duplicating display name logic for clipboard text** → Read [Clipboard Text Generation](clipboard-text-generation.md) first. Use get_copy_text() from registry.py as the single source of truth for clipboard text. Display name generators in command definitions are the canonical source. Do not duplicate this logic in app.py or detail screens.

**duplicating execute_palette_command logic between ErkDashApp and PlanDetailScreen** → Read [Dual Provider Pattern for Context-Agnostic Commands](dual-handler-pattern.md) first. This duplication is a known trade-off. Both ErkDashApp.execute_palette_command() and PlanDetailScreen.execute_command() implement the same command_id switch because they dispatch to different APIs (provider methods vs executor methods). See the asymmetries section below.

**extending PlanDataProvider ABC** → Read [TUI Architecture Overview](architecture.md) first. Requires 3-file update: abc.py + real.py + fake.py. Fake must initialize new dict in **init**. Missing init causes AttributeError at test time.

**extracting status indicators from the lifecycle display string** → Read [TUI Status Indicators](status-indicators.md) first. Indicators are computed from RAW PR state fields (is_draft, has_conflicts, review_decision), NOT extracted from lifecycle display. Use compute_status_indicators() for standalone display, format_lifecycle_with_status() for inline.

**formatting display strings during table render** → Read [TUI Data Contract](data-contract.md) first. Display strings are pre-formatted at fetch time. Add new \*\_display fields to PlanRowData and format in RealPlanDataProvider.\_build_row_data(), not in the widget layer.

**generating TUI commands that depend on optional PlanRowData fields** → Read [Adding Commands to TUI](adding-commands.md) first. Implement three-layer validation: registry predicate, handler guard, app-level helper. Never rely on registry predicate alone.

**implementing modal dismiss with an inverted key check condition** → Read [Modal Widget Embedding Pattern](modal-widget-embedding.md) first. Dismiss-on-unhandled pattern: if event.key not in (bound_keys): self.dismiss(). Using the inverted condition (if key in bound_keys: dismiss) is a common bug that dismisses on valid keys instead of unrecognized ones.

**implementing on_key() in a modal without calling event.prevent_default() and event.stop()** → Read [Modal Widget Embedding Pattern](modal-widget-embedding.md) first. Modal on_key() must call event.prevent_default() and event.stop() BEFORE any logic. Without this, keystrokes leak to the underlying view and trigger unintended actions.

**modifying how plan titles are displayed in TUI** → Read [TUI Plan Title Rendering Pipeline](plan-title-rendering-pipeline.md) first. Ensure `[erk-learn]` prefix is added BEFORE any filtering/sorting stages.

**moving @on decorated event handlers to a mixin** → Read [TUI Architecture Overview](architecture.md) first. Textual's \_MessagePumpMeta only scans class.**dict**, not inherited methods. Event handlers on mixins are silently ignored.

**passing --no-wait in worker thread subprocess calls** → Read [Async Action Refresh Pattern](async-action-refresh-pattern.md) first. Never pass --no-wait in worker threads — it defeats the polling purpose. The thread exists to wait for the operation to complete before refreshing.

**passing id= kwarg to PlanDataTable constructor** → Read [Modal Widget Embedding Pattern](modal-widget-embedding.md) first. PlanDataTable does not support the id= keyword argument. Use CSS selectors or widget references instead.

**pushing PlanBodyScreen without explicit content_type** → Read [TUI View Switching](view-switching.md) first. Content type must come from view_mode at push time, not derived inside the screen.

**putting PlanDataProvider ABC in src/erk/tui/** → Read [TUI Data Contract](data-contract.md) first. The ABC lives in erk-shared so provider implementations are co-located in the shared package. External consumers import from erk-shared alongside other shared gateways.

**reading self.\_view_mode during async data fetch without snapshotting** → Read [TUI Async State Snapshot Pattern](async-state-snapshot.md) first. Snapshot at fetch start with fetched_mode = self.\_view_mode. Read this doc.

**registering a new TUI command without a view-mode predicate** → Read [View-Aware Command Filtering](view-aware-commands.md) first. Every command must use \_is_plan_view() or \_is_objectives_view() to prevent it from appearing in the wrong view. Commands without view predicates appear in all views.

**removing a field from a frozen dataclass** → Read [Frozen Dataclass Field Management](frozen-dataclass-field-management.md) first. Grep for the class name across ALL constructor sites. Frozen dataclasses have 5+ places to update: field definition, real provider, fake provider, test helpers, and filtering/display logic. Missing one causes runtime TypeError.

**reusing same DOM element id across loading/empty/content states** → Read [TUI Architecture Overview](architecture.md) first. query_one() returns wrong element silently when id is reused across lifecycle phases. Use unique IDs per phase.

**showing toast from a modal screen** → Read [Dual Provider Pattern for Context-Agnostic Commands](dual-handler-pattern.md) first. Call self.dismiss() before app-level toasts. Modal blocks the correct z-layer, so toasts must render at app level after modal dismissal.

**using \_render() as a method name in Textual widgets** → Read [TUI View Switching](view-switching.md) first. Textual's LSP reserves \_render(). Use \_refresh_display() instead (see ViewBar).

**using a mutable set for \_stack_filter_branches** → Read [TUI Filter Pipeline Pattern](filter-pipeline.md) first. Stack filter branches use frozenset[str] for immutability and efficient membership testing. Do not use set or list.

**using inverted key check in on_key() modal dismiss logic** → Read [TUI Modal Screen Pattern](modal-screen-pattern.md) first. if event.key not in (...) is WRONG for dismiss logic — it swallows dismiss keys. Use if event.key in (...) to check for positive dismiss. Regression caused by stacked PR merge order.

**using positional arguments when constructing PlanRowData** → Read [Frozen Dataclass Field Management](frozen-dataclass-field-management.md) first. Always use keyword arguments for frozen dataclass construction. Positional arguments break silently when fields are reordered. Use make_plan_row() helper in tests.

**using run.branch directly for display without checking PR head_branch first** → Read [Runs Tab Architecture](runs-tab-architecture.md) first. After merge+deletion, run.branch becomes master/main. Use PR head_branch as primary source, falling back to run.branch only if not master/main.

**using subprocess.Popen in TUI code without stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL** → Read [Command Execution Strategies](command-execution.md) first. Child processes inherit stdin from parent; in TUI context this creates deadlocks when child prompts for user input. Always set `stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL` for TUI subprocess calls.

**using subprocess.Popen without bufsize=1 for streaming** → Read [TUI Streaming Output Patterns](streaming-output.md) first. Use bufsize=1 with text=True for line-buffered streaming Popen output. Without it, output may be block-buffered.

**using subprocess.run() instead of \_run_streaming_operation() for TUI commands** → Read [TUI Multi-Operation Tracking](multi-operation-tracking.md) first. TUI background operations must use \_run_streaming_operation() for live progress. subprocess.run() blocks without streaming and produces no status bar updates.

**using title-stripping functions** → Read [TUI Plan Title Rendering Pipeline](plan-title-rendering-pipeline.md) first. Distinguish `_strip_plan_prefixes` (PR creation) vs `_strip_plan_markers` (plan creation) vs `strip_plan_from_filename` (filename handling).
