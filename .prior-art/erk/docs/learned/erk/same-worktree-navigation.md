# Same-Worktree Navigation

When a navigation command's target is the worktree the user is already in, erk adjusts its activation behavior to avoid redundant shell commands.

## Detection Pattern

```python
same_worktree = target_path.resolve() == ctx.cwd.resolve()
```

Uses `Path.resolve()` on both sides to normalize symlinks and relative paths. Never use string comparison.

## Call Sites

The detection pattern is used at 4 locations:

<!-- Source: src/erk/cli/commands/wt/checkout_cmd.py:123 -->
<!-- Source: src/erk/cli/commands/wt/create_cmd.py:908 (--from-branch path) -->
<!-- Source: src/erk/cli/commands/navigation_helpers.py:243 -->
<!-- Source: src/erk/cli/commands/branch/checkout_cmd.py:251 -->

1. `wt/checkout_cmd.py` — worktree checkout
2. `wt/create_cmd.py` — `--from-branch` slot allocation path
3. `navigation_helpers.py` — `activate_target()` helper
4. `branch/checkout_cmd.py` — branch checkout

Several other call sites pass `same_worktree=False` statically (e.g., `wt/create_cmd.py` for new worktree paths, `branch/create_cmd.py`, `pr/checkout_cmd.py`) because creation always targets a new worktree.

## Affected Functions

### `build_activation_command()`

<!-- Source: src/erk/cli/activation.py:57-94 -->

`build_activation_command(config, script_path, *, same_worktree: bool)` returns a shell command string. When `same_worktree=True` and no implement command is needed, returns an empty string (skipping the `source activate.sh` prefix).

### `print_activation_instructions()`

<!-- Source: src/erk/cli/activation.py:323-386 -->

`print_activation_instructions(..., *, same_worktree: bool)` prints activation instructions. When `same_worktree=True`, it:

- Skips the `source activate.sh` prefix
- Suppresses the entire activation block if there's nothing actionable to show

## Deletion in Same-Worktree Scenarios

When `erk down -d` navigates to a worktree the user is already in (`same_worktree=True`), the deletion commands are shown differently:

- Shows the actual `gt delete` commands directly instead of suggesting `erk br delete` (which would incorrectly try to delete the shared worktree)
- Filters out `git worktree remove` and `erk slot unassign` commands
- Copies the filtered commands to clipboard via OSC 52
