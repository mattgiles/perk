# Codespace Remote Execution Pattern

This document covers the **centralized environment bootstrap** for remote codespace commands — why it exists, how it fails, and when to bypass it. For the five-step composition pattern (resolve → start → build → execute → report), see [Composable Remote Commands](../architecture/composable-remote-commands.md). For choosing between `exec_ssh_interactive()` and `run_ssh_command()`, see [SSH Command Execution](../architecture/ssh-command-execution.md).

## Why a Centralized Bootstrap Wrapper

Remote erk commands can't assume the codespace environment is ready. Between SSH connections, the codespace may have stale code, missing dependencies, or a deactivated virtualenv. Rather than making each remote command handle its own setup, erk centralizes the bootstrap in a single function.

<!-- Source: src/erk/core/codespace_run.py, build_codespace_ssh_command -->

See `build_codespace_ssh_command()` in `src/erk/core/codespace_run.py` for the implementation.

**The core design decision**: Bootstrap is a cross-cutting concern. If each command inlined its own setup steps, adding a new bootstrap step (e.g., a health check) would require touching every remote command file. Centralization means bootstrap changes propagate automatically.

## Bootstrap Sequence Design

The wrapper chains operations with `&&` inside `bash -l -c '...'`. The sequence now supports an optional branch checkout prefix:

1. **Branch checkout** _(optional)_ — `git fetch origin <branch> && git checkout <branch>` — ensures the codespace is on the same branch as the local machine
2. **`git pull`** — ensures the remote has latest code, since the codespace may have been idle for hours or days
3. **`uv sync`** — installs any new/changed dependencies from the (potentially updated) `pyproject.toml`
4. **`source .venv/bin/activate`** — activates the virtualenv so `erk` resolves to the project's entry point
5. **The actual erk command** — runs only if all setup steps succeed

### Why These Design Choices

**Fail-fast chaining (`&&`)**: If `git pull` fails (merge conflict, network issue), the erk command never runs against stale code. This prevents subtly wrong results that are harder to debug than a visible bootstrap failure.

**Login shell (`bash -l`)**: Ensures `~/.profile` and `~/.bash_profile` are sourced, which is required for user-local binaries like Claude Code (installed to `~/.claude/local/`). Without `-l`, the `claude` command isn't found.

**Sequential ordering**: The steps have strict dependencies — `uv sync` must run after `git pull` (new code may add dependencies), and venv activation must happen after sync.

**Anti-pattern**: Skipping `git pull` for "speed." A codespace running against stale code produces subtly wrong results that are much harder to debug than a slow startup.

## Debugging Bootstrap Failures

The `&&`-chain means the actual error appears in terminal output, but knowing _which_ step failed requires interpreting the output:

| Symptom                     | Likely failed step            | Recovery                                              |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Merge conflict messages     | `git pull`                    | `erk codespace connect --shell`, resolve manually     |
| Package resolution errors   | `uv sync`                     | Run `uv sync` interactively to see full error details |
| "command not found: erk"    | `source .venv/bin/activate`   | Venv may be corrupted — recreate with `uv venv`       |
| "command not found: claude" | `bash -l` not loading profile | Check `~/.bash_profile` on the codespace              |

**Key strategy**: Use `erk codespace connect --shell` to drop into a bare shell, then run bootstrap steps manually one at a time to isolate the failure.

## Branch Checkout Injection

<!-- Source: src/erk/cli/commands/codespace/connect_cmd.py, connect_codespace -->

The `connect` command injects an optional `checkout_prefix` into the bootstrap sequence when a local branch is detected. This ensures the codespace checks out the same branch as the local machine:

When a local branch is detected, the command builds a checkout prefix that fetches and checks out that branch. See the checkout prefix construction in `src/erk/cli/commands/codespace/connect_cmd.py`.

The prefix is injected into both shell and non-shell modes. In shell mode, the full sequence becomes `{cd_prefix}{checkout_prefix}{export_prefix}exec bash -l`. In non-shell mode: `{cd_prefix}{checkout_prefix}{export_prefix}{setup} && {claude_cmd}`.

A `NoRepoSentinel` guard (lines 61-70) prevents checkout injection when running outside a git repository — `local_branch` is set to `None`, and the prefix is empty.

**Prefix ordering**: CD → Checkout → Export → Command. CD must come first (so the repo is accessible), checkout next (so the correct branch's code is used for subsequent steps), then exports (environment setup).

## When to Use vs When to Bypass

Not all codespace commands use `build_codespace_ssh_command()`. The `connect` command builds its own command string because its `--shell` mode skips setup entirely (just `bash -l`). This shell escape hatch exists precisely for debugging when the bootstrap itself is broken.

**Decision rule**: Use `build_codespace_ssh_command()` for any command running a specific erk CLI remotely. Build the string manually only when the command needs a fundamentally different setup flow (like shell-only mode).

## Design Constraints

**Idempotency requirement**: Every bootstrap step must be safe to run repeatedly. Codespaces may be warm (ran a command 5 minutes ago) or cold (idle for 12 hours). The same bootstrap runs either way.

**No partial bootstrap**: You can't skip `git pull` even if you just pushed. The wrapper always runs the full sequence — simplicity over optimization.

**Single-quote escaping limitation**: The erk command is embedded inside single quotes. Commands with single quotes in their arguments will break the shell wrapping. This hasn't been a practical issue because erk CLI arguments don't contain quotes, but it's a structural constraint to be aware of.

**Single-argument SSH constraint**: The entire `bash -l -c '...'` string must be passed as one argument to SSH. See [SSH Command Execution](../architecture/ssh-command-execution.md) for why SSH's argument concatenation breaks multi-argument commands.
