# PR Address Workflows

Erk provides two workflows for addressing PR review comments using Claude:

1. **Local** (`/erk:pr-address`) - Claude Code slash command, runs in your terminal
2. **Remote** (`erk launch pr-address --pr <number>`) - GitHub Actions workflow, runs in CI

## Decision Matrix

| Factor                       | Local                        | Remote                         |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Branch checkout**          | Required (must be on branch) | Not required                   |
| **Interactive confirmation** | Yes (via Claude Code)        | No                             |
| **Error recovery**           | Immediate (fix and retry)    | Check workflow logs            |
| **Plan metadata tracking**   | Manual                       | Automatic for `plnd/` branches |
| **Best for**                 | Active development           | Queued/async work              |

## Local Workflow: /erk:pr-address

The `/erk:pr-address` slash command addresses review comments on the current branch.

### Usage

```bash
# Must be on the PR branch
erk br co my-feature
/erk:pr-address
```

### What it does

1. Fetches unresolved review comments from GitHub
2. Presents each comment to Claude for addressing
3. Claude makes code changes to address the feedback
4. You review and commit the changes

### When to use

- You're actively working on the branch
- You want interactive control over changes
- You want to review changes before committing

### Plan File Mode

When the PR's diff consists of a git-tracked `.erk/impl-context/plan.md`, `/erk:pr-address` automatically enters **Plan File Mode**. This mode handles feedback on plan-only PRs (created by the plan save workflow).

#### How it's triggered

<!-- Source: .claude/commands/erk/pr-address.md, Phase 0 section -->

Phase 0 uses a file-based detection check (see Phase 0 in `pr-address.md`) to determine if `.erk/impl-context/plan.md` is git-tracked. If the file is tracked, Plan File Mode activates.

See [Phase 0 Detection Pattern](../architecture/phase-zero-detection-pattern.md) for the detection mechanism.

#### What's different in Plan File Mode

| Aspect             | Code Review Mode                    | Plan File Mode                          |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Trigger**        | Default                             | Git-tracked `.erk/impl-context/plan.md` |
| **File modified**  | Source code files                   | `.erk/impl-context/plan.md`             |
| **PR description** | Updated via `update-pr-description` | Skipped (plan PRs have own format)      |
| **Push method**    | Graphite submit                     | `git push` directly                     |

#### Behavioral constraint

The key constraint in Plan File Mode: all feedback is interpreted as "modify the plan text". When a reviewer says "add a step for X", you add text to the plan _describing_ step X — you do NOT actually implement X.

## Remote Workflow: erk launch pr-address

The `erk launch pr-address` command triggers a GitHub Actions workflow to address comments without local checkout.

### Usage

```bash
# From any directory in the repo
erk launch pr-address --pr 123

# With a specific model
erk launch pr-address --pr 123 --model claude-opus-4
```

### What it does

1. Triggers `pr-address.yml` GitHub Actions workflow
2. Workflow checks out the PR branch
3. Runs `/erk:pr-address` in CI
4. Pushes any changes
5. Posts a summary comment on the PR

### Plan Dispatch Metadata Tracking

When the branch name follows the `plnd/` prefix pattern (e.g., `plnd/add-feature-03-07-1234`), the command automatically updates the plan with dispatch metadata:

- `last_dispatch_run_id` - The workflow run ID
- `last_dispatch_node_id` - The workflow run node ID (for GraphQL)
- `last_dispatched_at` - ISO timestamp

This enables tracking which workflow runs are associated with which plans.

### Requirements

- PR must exist and be OPEN
- GitHub Actions secrets configured:
  - `ERK_QUEUE_GH_PAT` - PAT with `repo` scope
  - `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

### When to use

- You don't want to switch branches locally
- You're processing multiple PRs in a queue
- You want async/background processing

## Summary Comment

After the remote workflow completes, it posts (or updates) a summary comment on the PR with:

- Model used
- Job status (success/failure)
- Link to workflow run
- Summary of changes made

The comment uses the marker `<!-- erk:pr-address-run -->` to find and update existing comments.

## Classifier-to-Dash Alignment Invariant

The PR feedback classifier's output must align with the TUI dashboard's unresolved comments count. Specifically, the total number of review threads reported by the classifier must equal the count shown in the TUI dashboard. Missing threads are silently dropped, so discrepancies indicate a classifier bug.

## Bot Thread Inflation

Bot-generated review threads (automated linting, CI notifications) inflate the `informational_count` but are expected behavior. The classifier categorizes bot threads as informational rather than actionable.

## Operational Procedures

### Batch Thread Resolution

After fixing code based on review feedback, use `erk exec resolve-review-threads` to resolve all addressed threads in one operation. This avoids manually resolving threads one-by-one through the GitHub UI.

### False Positive Handling

Review bots (test-coverage-review, dignified-python-review, etc.) can produce false positives. To handle:

1. **Identify**: Check if the review comment is from a bot (automated review system)
2. **Batch resolve**: Use `erk exec resolve-review-threads` after confirming the comments are false positives
3. **Verify**: Run `erk exec get-pr-review-comments` afterward to confirm all threads are resolved (expect an empty array)

### Review Thread vs Discussion Comment Distinction

GitHub has two distinct comment types on PRs:

- **Review threads**: Created via "Start a review" or inline code comments. Have a `threadId` and can be resolved/unreresolved.
- **Discussion comments**: General PR-level comments (the main comment stream). Do NOT have thread IDs and cannot be "resolved" in the same way.

`resolve-review-threads` only operates on review threads. Discussion comments are counted in `informational_count` and handled separately.

## informational_count Field Semantics

The `informational_count` field in classifier output covers **only** discussion comments (general PR-level comments), NOT review threads. All unresolved review threads must appear individually in `actionable_threads`. This is an important distinction: a high `informational_count` does not indicate missing actionable items.
