# Bundled Skill Capabilities

Skills bundled in the erk wheel need `SkillCapability` registration to be visible to `erk init` and `erk artifact sync`. Without registration, skills are invisible to the capability system.

## Problem

Skills bundled in the wheel (like `dignified-python`, `fake-driven-testing`) are discovered by `codex_portable_skills()` but had no `SkillCapability` registration. This made them invisible to:

- `erk init` (couldn't install them)
- `erk artifact sync` (couldn't detect drift)
- Capability listing commands

## Solution: Parameterized Factory

Instead of creating individual `SkillCapability` subclasses for each simple skill, a generic `BundledSkillCapability` class and a factory function handle batch registration.

### Components

<!-- Source: src/erk/capabilities/skills/bundled.py, bundled_skills -->

**`bundled_skills()` function** -- cached dict mapping skill names to descriptions. See `bundled_skills()` in `src/erk/capabilities/skills/bundled.py` for the current entries.

**`BundledSkillCapability` class** -- generic SkillCapability that takes name and description as constructor parameters rather than requiring a subclass for each skill.

**`create_bundled_skill_capabilities()` factory** -- creates a list of BundledSkillCapability instances from the `bundled_skills()` dict.

### Registry Splice Pattern

<!-- Source: src/erk/core/capabilities/registry.py, _all_capabilities -->

The factory output is unpacked into the capabilities tuple using `*create_bundled_skill_capabilities()` in `_all_capabilities()`. See `_all_capabilities()` in `src/erk/core/capabilities/registry.py` for the full declaration. The `*` operator unpacks the list into individual tuple items, keeping the registry declaration clean.

### Import-Time Safety

The `@cache` decorator on `bundled_skills()` defers dict creation to first use, avoiding import-time allocation.

## When to Use Bundled vs Dedicated

| Pattern                              | When to Use                                                            |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bundled factory (`bundled_skills()`) | Simple skills with no custom install logic                             |
| Dedicated `SkillCapability` subclass | Skills needing custom install behavior (e.g., `LearnedDocsCapability`) |

If a skill just needs to be copied from the wheel to the project, use the bundled factory. If it needs to generate content, check conditions, or perform custom setup during install, create a dedicated subclass.

## Drift Prevention Test

`tests/unit/core/capabilities/test_skills.py` contains `test_all_codex_portable_skills_have_capability()` which verifies every skill in `codex_portable_skills()` has a registered capability. If a new skill is added to the portable skills list without a corresponding capability, this test fails with instructions:

> Add it to bundled_skills() in bundled.py or create a dedicated capability class
