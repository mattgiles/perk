# Bundled Artifact Portability

Erk bundles `.claude/` and `.github/` artifacts into the wheel so `erk artifact sync` can install them into external projects. A subset of these artifacts are "portable" — they work with any AI coding agent, not just Claude Code. This document explains the portability classification, the dual-path bundling architecture, and why certain design choices were made.

## Why Two Bundle Targets?

<!-- Source: pyproject.toml:60-87 -->

The `force-include` section in `pyproject.toml` maps source artifacts to `erk/data/claude/` in the wheel. All skills (both Claude-only and portable) are now bundled to this single path. The Codex backend falls back to the Claude path at runtime.

This unified path simplifies the build system. The portability registry (`codex_portable_skills()`) still determines which skills get installed to which target directory (`.claude/skills/` vs `.codex/skills/`) at sync time — the distinction only matters during `erk artifact sync`, not at the wheel level.

## Portability Classification

<!-- Source: src/erk/core/capabilities/codex_portable.py, codex_portable_skills -->
<!-- Source: src/erk/core/capabilities/codex_portable.py, claude_only_skills -->

Skills are classified into two registries in `codex_portable.py`. See `codex_portable_skills()` and `claude_only_skills()` for the current lists. The classification criteria:

| Criterion                      | Portable                                           | Claude-Only                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hooks (PreToolUse/PostToolUse) | None — all instructions self-contained in SKILL.md | May depend on hook-injected context                         |
| Tool dependencies              | Standard set (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob) | Claude-specific (TodoWrite, EnterPlanMode, AskUserQuestion) |
| System prompt overrides        | None                                               | May use them                                                |
| Session log access             | None                                               | May inspect `~/.claude/projects/`                           |

**Why this matters**: Installing a skill that calls `TodoWrite` into a non-Claude project causes runtime failures. The registry prevents `erk artifact sync` from copying incompatible skills.

## Single Canonical Location Rule

Each skill must exist in exactly one portability category. This is enforced at two levels:

1. **Registry level**: A skill appears in either `codex_portable_skills()` or `claude_only_skills()`, never both
2. **Build level**: All `force-include` entries map to `erk/data/claude/`; the portability registry controls sync-time routing

Violating this creates confusing sync behavior where the same skill could be installed from two different sources with potentially different content.

## The Editable Install Subtlety

<!-- Source: src/erk/artifacts/paths.py, get_bundled_codex_dir -->
<!-- Source: src/erk/artifacts/paths.py, _is_editable_install -->

The path resolution in `paths.py` uses a dual-path strategy because editable installs (development) and wheel installs (distribution) have fundamentally different directory layouts. The detection heuristic checks whether `site-packages` appears in the resolved package path.

**The non-obvious design decision**: In editable mode, `get_bundled_codex_dir()` returns the `.claude/` directory — not a `.codex/` directory — because `.claude/` and `.codex/` use identical file formats (YAML frontmatter with name and description). The sync step handles the target directory mapping at install time. This avoids maintaining a separate `.codex/` directory in the repo that would just mirror `.claude/skills/`.

## Staleness Detection: Two Signals

<!-- Source: src/erk/artifacts/artifact_health.py, _determine_status -->

The artifact health system uses version + content hash comparison (stored in `.erk/state.toml`) to classify each artifact into one of four states: `up-to-date`, `changed-upstream`, `locally-modified`, and `not-installed`.

The two-signal approach exists to distinguish two different scenarios that a single signal would conflate:

- **Hash changed, same version** → user edited the artifact locally (`locally-modified`) → sync should warn, not overwrite
- **Hash changed, different version** → new erk release changed the artifact (`changed-upstream`) → sync should update

This distinction is why `_determine_status()` checks both signals rather than just comparing hashes. Without the version signal, the system couldn't tell whether the user or an erk upgrade caused the content difference.

## Adding a New Portable Skill

When making a skill portable:

1. **Verify no Claude-only dependencies** — confirm the skill doesn't reference hooks, Claude-specific tools, or session log paths
2. **Add to `codex_portable_skills()`** in `codex_portable.py`
3. **Add force-include entry** mapping `.claude/skills/{name}` to `erk/data/claude/skills/{name}` in `pyproject.toml`
4. **Keep source in `.claude/skills/`** — the skill's source of truth stays in `.claude/`; the build system handles remapping

**Anti-pattern**: Moving the skill source directory to a `.codex/` folder in the repo. There is no `.codex/` directory in the erk repo. All skills live in `.claude/skills/` regardless of portability; the distinction only matters at build and sync time.
