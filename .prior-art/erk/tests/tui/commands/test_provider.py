"""Tests for RunCommandProvider integration layer.

The RunCommandProvider delegates to get_available_run_commands() and
get_run_display_name() from the registry. These tests verify the
Provider-level integration: that discover yields the right commands
and search filters them correctly.

Since Textual Provider instances require full app context and are
not directly accessible, we test the underlying logic that the
Provider calls: get_available_run_commands with RunCommandContext.
