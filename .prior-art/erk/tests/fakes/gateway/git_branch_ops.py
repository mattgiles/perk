    State Management:
    -----------------
    This fake maintains mutable state to simulate git's stateful behavior.
    Operations like create_branch, checkout_branch modify internal state.

    -----------------
    This fake tracks mutations for test assertions via read-only properties:

    - checked_out_branches: Branches checked out via checkout_branch()
    - detached_checkouts: Refs checked out via checkout_detached()
