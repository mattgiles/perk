### Added

- Support creating objectives without a roadmap: `erk objective create` and `erk objective check` now work for standalone objectives not tied to any roadmap.

### Changed

- Generalize `--dangerous` flag configuration across rebase, reconcile-with-remote, and address commands: all three now share a single config key (`require_dangerous_flag_for_implicitly_dangerous_operations`) with consistent error messaging
- Remove upstack child branch existence check in `erk land --up`: landing no longer fails when an upstack child branch has been deleted remotely
- Show progress feedback during PR description generation: `erk pr submit` and `erk pr rewrite` now display "Still waiting..." messages at 3-second intervals while Claude generates the PR description, replacing silence during long API call windows.
- Auto-activate worktree environment on stack-in-place checkout: When using `erk br co` from an assigned slot, the activation script now runs automatically instead of printing copy-paste instructions.

- Always run `uv sync` during worktree activation regardless of VIRTUAL_ENV state

### Fixed

- Fix `erk down -d` for same-worktree downstack navigation: delete-after-navigate now works correctly within the same worktree
- Fix PR body section order: move "Key Changes" before "Files Changed" in generated PR descriptions
- Fix `erk down -f -d` from root worktree with non-trunk branch: Navigation to trunk from the root worktree no longer fails with "Cannot create worktree for trunk branch" when a non-trunk branch is checked out.
- Fix `erk pr dispatch` when no impl-context reference exists: Dispatch auto-detection now falls back to resolving the plan number from the current branch via the GitHub API.
- Fix dispatch metadata write for plans missing a plan-header: A minimal plan-header is now created automatically before writing dispatch metadata, preventing a silent failure.
- Fix impl-context files leaking into implementation PRs: Removes an incorrect optimization that preserved impl-context for plan branches during submit pipeline cleanup.
- Fix `erk up/down` navigation when worktree has a different branch checked out
- Fix slot reuse incorrectly treating untracked files as dirty

### Removed

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-27 14:23 PT

### Release Overview

This release completes the migration to draft PRs as the sole plan backend, consolidates CLI commands under `erk pr`, and delivers major TUI dashboard improvements for filtering, async operations, and objective visibility.

#### Draft PR as Sole Plan Backend

**What it solves:** Dual plan backends (GitHub issues vs draft PRs) created complexity — every workflow needed to support both paths, and the issue-based backend lacked native diff views and CI integration.

**How it works:** Draft PRs are now the only plan backend. The `PlanBackendType` enum, `get_plan_backend()`, and all issue-based code paths have been removed. Plan metadata is consolidated to `plan-ref.json`, replacing the legacy `.impl/issue.json`.

**Key features:** No configuration needed — draft PR is the default and only option. Simplified plan-save, plan-implement, and learn pipelines.

#### CLI Consolidation under `erk pr`

**What it solves:** Plan management commands were spread across `erk plan` and `erk pr`, creating confusion about where to find commands.

**How it works:** All plan management commands (create, list, submit, checkout, close, view, log, replan, duplicate-check) are now under `erk pr <verb>`. The `erk plan` group has been removed. Branch names no longer encode plan IDs — plans are linked to branches via `plan-ref.json`.

**Key features:** `erk pr list`, `erk pr checkout`, `erk pr close`, `erk pr replan`, `erk pr duplicate-check`.

#### TUI Dashboard Polish

**What it solves:** The dashboard needed better filtering, async feedback, and objective visibility for managing large numbers of plans.

**How it works:** New filtering modes (by objective with `o`, by stack), persistent status bar messages for async operations, fire-and-forget dispatch, sparkline progress indicators for objectives, and clickable tab labels for mouse-driven navigation.

**Key features:** Objective filter (`o`), stack filter, failing CI checks modal (`h`), clickable ViewBar tabs, "blockers" column in Objectives dashboard, stacked PR indicators.

#### Non-Blocking TUI Operations

**What it solves:** Remote operations (dispatch, address, fix-conflicts) blocked the TUI with modal dialogs, preventing other work during long-running operations.

**How it works:** All remote operations now use a toast+worker pattern — they return immediately with a status notification, and results appear as persistent messages when complete.

**Key features:** Fire-and-forget dispatch, non-blocking fix-conflicts, persistent status bar messages.

### Release Overview

This release introduces dual plan backends, evolves objectives into a dependency graph, and streamlines branch management with stack-in-place workflows.

#### Draft PR Plan Backend

**What it solves:** Issue-based plans have limitations for code-heavy workflows — no native diff view, no CI integration, and awkward code review. Draft PRs provide a natural home for plans that will become code.

**How it works:** Plans can now be stored as GitHub draft PRs instead of issues, with `ERK_PLAN_BACKEND=draft_pr` controlling the backend. All workflows (plan-save, plan-implement, learn, CI) support both backends transparently.

**Key features:** `ERK_PLAN_BACKEND` environment variable, draft PR auto-publishing during `erk pr submit`, backend-agnostic plan checkout via `erk br co --for-plan`.

#### Objective Dependency Graph

**What it solves:** Objectives with linear roadmaps couldn't express real-world dependencies — some nodes can run in parallel, others must wait. The flat step list forced artificial sequencing.

**How it works:** Objectives now use a graph-based model (schema v3) with `depends_on` support between nodes. The vocabulary shifted from "steps" to "nodes" to reflect the graph structure. `erk objective view` displays the dependency graph, and `--all-unblocked` enables parallel dispatch of independent nodes.

**Key features:** `depends_on` field in objective roadmaps, "deps" column in TUI Objectives dashboard, `--all-unblocked` dispatch, `erk objective view` with dependency graph display.

#### Autonomous One-Shot Dispatch

**What it solves:** The plan-then-implement workflow requires human involvement at each stage. For well-defined tasks, this overhead isn't justified.

**How it works:** `erk one-shot` dispatches fully autonomous remote execution — an agent creates a plan, implements it, and submits a PR without user intervention. Extended to objectives via `erk objective next-plan --one-shot` for auto-dispatching the next unblocked roadmap node.

**Key features:** `erk one-shot` with `--file` and `--model` flags, `erk objective next-plan --one-shot`, automatic "Closes #N" PR references.

#### Stack-in-Place Branch Management

**What it solves:** Each stacked branch previously required its own worktree slot, limiting parallelism and wasting disk space.

**How it works:** `erk br create` in assigned worktree slots now updates the assignment tip in place, enabling stacked branches to share a single worktree. Plan checkout unified under `erk br co --for-plan` with `--new-slot` option.

**Key features:** `erk br co --for-plan`, `--new-slot` flag, `erk wt create-from` for adopting existing branches. `erk prepare` removed.

#### TUI Dashboard Evolution

**What it solves:** The dashboard was a single-view plans list. Users needed to switch between plans, learn sessions, and objectives constantly.

**How it works:** The dashboard now supports Plans, Learn, and Objectives views (toggled via 1/2/3 keys or arrow keys), with a launch screen for two-keystroke command execution. PR status indicators, author filtering, and lifecycle labels provide at-a-glance visibility.

**Key features:** View switching (1/2/3 keys), launch screen, branch and author columns, PR status display (draft/conflicts/review), non-blocking toast notifications.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-01-24 15:12 PT

### Release Overview

This release adds remote execution capabilities, plan replanning workflows, and numerous TUI improvements for managing plans and PRs.

#### GitHub Codespaces Integration

**What it solves:** Running Claude implementations locally can be resource-intensive and requires keeping your machine available.

**How it works:** Create and manage Codespaces that can execute Claude implementations remotely. Codespaces are provisioned with erk and Claude Code pre-configured.

**Key features:** `erk codespace setup`, `erk codespace connect`, `--codespace` flag for `erk implement` and `erk prepare`.

#### Remote PR Review Addressing

**What it solves:** Addressing PR review comments previously required checking out the branch locally.

**How it works:** Triggers GitHub Actions to run Claude in CI, which reads review comments, makes changes, and pushes commits.

**Key features:** `erk pr address-remote` command, available in TUI via command palette.

#### Plan Replanning

**What it solves:** Plans can become stale as the codebase evolves, requiring re-evaluation against current state.

**How it works:** Re-reads the original plan context and generates an updated implementation plan considering recent changes.

**Key features:** `erk plan replan` CLI command, TUI shortcut "6" for replanning selected plans.

#### Branch Sync Intelligence

**What it solves:** Diverged branches cause confusing errors during stack operations.

**How it works:** Detects divergence between local and remote branches, offering intelligent sync/rebase options.

**Key features:** `/erk:sync-divergence` command, automatic divergence detection in land and sync commands.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-01-20 07:57 PT

### Major Changes

- **Convention-based code review system**: Introduces automatic code review discovery and execution based on conventions. Capabilities can define review workflows that run automatically on PRs. Users benefit from consistent, automated review checks without manual configuration.

- **Clickable activation commands with clipboard support**: Activation commands now display as clickable OSC 8 hyperlinks and automatically copy to clipboard via OSC 52. `erk implement` now defaults to `--here` mode (in-place implementation) removing pool slot management. Users can click activation commands directly or paste from clipboard instead of manual copy-paste.

- **Shell integration removed**: The shell integration system (shell wrappers, automatic directory switching, ERK_SHELL env var) has been completely eliminated. Navigation commands now print activation script instructions instead of automatically switching directories. Users source activation scripts manually or use `cd`. This simplifies the architecture while keeping core erk functionality intact.

- **Remote conflict resolution workflow**: Added `erk pr fix-conflicts-remote` command to trigger AI-powered conflict resolution on GitHub Actions without checking out branches locally. Squashes commits, rebases onto base branch, and uses Claude to resolve conflicts. Available in TUI via "5" key.

### Added

- Add activation script generation when allocating worktree slots
- Add shell completion (bash/zsh) to worktree activation script
- Add `--local` mode to code review for pre-PR review execution

## [0.5.0] - 2026-01-11 23:58 PT

### Release Overview

The 0.5.0 release consolidates four major systems that transform erk from a plan execution tool into a comprehensive platform for AI-assisted software engineering.

#### Objective System

Erk plans solve the single-PR problem well, but real engineering work often spans multiple related PRs toward a coherent goal. The Objective System provides coordination infrastructure for multi-PR initiatives.

**What it solves:** Context loss between related implementations. When work spans multiple sessions and PRs, design decisions, lessons learned, and progress tracking were previously scattered or lost entirely.

**How it works:** An objective is a GitHub issue (labeled `erk-objective`) that acts as a coordination document and changelog. It contains a phased roadmap breaking work into shippable PRs, design decisions that guide all related work, and action comments that capture lessons learned as each piece lands. Objectives can be completeable –– a defined set of substeps or phases –– or a permanent objective, that can be continuously evaluated against a system for all of time (e.g. ensure all files are less than 20k tokens).

**Key workflow:**

- `erk objective create` - Interactive creation with structure recommendations (steelthread-first development)
- `erk objective next-plan` - Pick a roadmap step and generate an implementation plan
- `erk land` integration - Automatically prompts to update objectives when landing related PRs

Objectives are human-first markdown documents optimized for session handoff—any future session can pick up implementation without re-exploring context.

#### Learning System

AI agents discover valuable insights during implementation: API quirks, architectural patterns, edge cases, and design rationale. This knowledge typically evaporates once the PR lands. The Learning System systematically captures and codifies these discoveries.

**What it solves:** Knowledge loss from implementation sessions. Claude reads files, discovers patterns, encounters gotchas, and makes decisions—but none of this persists beyond the session.

**How it works:** `erk learn` discovers all Claude Code sessions associated with a plan (planning session, implementation sessions) and launches Claude to analyze them. The `/erk:learn` skill performs deep session analysis, extracting documentation items that fill genuine knowledge gaps rather than duplicating existing documentation.

**Key features:**

- Session discovery from GitHub metadata and local logs
- Compressed XML preprocessing for efficient context
- Categorization: Learning gaps (external knowledge) vs Teaching gaps (documenting new features)
- Automated workflow via `learn-workflow` capability for hands-off documentation generation

The system creates a virtuous cycle: each implementation makes future implementations faster through accumulated documentation.

#### Capability-Based Architecture

As erk's feature set grew, initialization became unwieldy—a monolithic process that installed everything or nothing. The Capability System introduces modular, pluggable optional features.

**What it solves:** All-or-nothing feature installation. Different repositories need different features: some want code review workflows, others want the statusline, some want reminder systems. Previously this required manual file management.

**How it works:** Each capability is a self-contained unit with declarative installation, dependency checking, and status tracking. Capabilities span multiple types: skills, workflows, agents, reminders, and infrastructure settings. They can be project-scoped (per-repository) or user-scoped (global).

**Key commands:**

- `erk init capability list` - Show all available capabilities
- `erk init capability check` - Verify installation status
- `erk init capability add <name>` - Install one or more capabilities

Available capabilities include `dignified-python`, `fake-driven-testing`, `dignified-review`, `learn-workflow`, `statusline`, `shell-integration`, and reminder systems for coding standards enforcement.

#### Worktree Pool System

Git worktrees enable parallel development, but naive worktree management caused significant problems: slow creation, `index.lock` race conditions, shell state contamination, and unbounded resource consumption.

**What it solves:** The pool system addresses performance (worktree creation is slow), resource management (worktrees accumulating on disk), `index.lock` contention (concurrent git operations conflicting), and shell state isolation (clean separation of session artifacts).

**How it works:** Instead of creating and destroying worktrees on-demand, erk maintains a configurable pool of pre-allocated slots (`erk-slot-01` through `erk-slot-04` by default). Branches are assigned to slots dynamically, with LRU eviction when the pool is full. Placeholder branches hold unassigned slots ready for instant reuse.

**Key commands:**

- `erk slot init-pool` - Pre-allocate all slots
- `erk slot list` - Unified pool health view (assignments, status, issues)
- `erk slot repair` - Auto-fix stale assignments and orphaned state

The system includes comprehensive diagnostics detecting orphaned state, missing branches, and branch mismatches, with automatic repair capabilities.

## [0.4.7] - 2026-01-11 02:19 PT

### Major Changes

- **Shell integration is now optional**: `erk implement` works without shell integration configured. When ERK_SHELL is not set, erk spawns a subshell in the worktree and launches Claude automatically.
- **Simplified worktree preservation in `erk land`**: The command now always preserves slot worktrees when landing PRs, only deleting the branch. This prevents accidental worktree loss and makes the workflow more predictable for users with persistent worktree setups.
- **Reorganized init process into capabilities**: The init command now uses a capability-based architecture with `erk init capability` subcommands. Capabilities can be managed at project or user scope, and include skills, workflows, agents, and groups.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-01-04 18:09 PT

### Major Changes

- **Worktree Pool System**: Pre-initialized worktree slots replace ephemeral worktree creation. Creating and deleting worktrees on larger repositories caused significant problems: shells left on deleted working directories, an epidemic of git `index.lock` issues, and slow worktree operations. The pool system maintains a configurable number of persistent slots that are reused across assignments. Commands: `erk slot init`, `erk slot list`, and `erk slot repair`.

- **`erk br` namespace for branch management**: Consolidated branch lifecycle commands (`create`, `assign`, `unassign`) under `erk br` (short alias for `branch`). The `slot` group now focuses exclusively on pool infrastructure. Includes `--no-slot` flag for creating branches without slot assignment.

- **`erk pr fix-conflicts` command**: AI-powered merge conflict resolution. When rebasing causes conflicts, this command uses Claude to analyze and resolve conflicts automatically.

### Added

- Detect uncommitted changes before checkout in slot assignment with user-friendly error messages
- Add `erk slot repair` command to remove stale assignments from pool state
- Create `/erk:implement-stacked-plan` command for stacked branch implementation
- Add visible URL column to objective list command output
- Add `pool.max_slots` configuration and worktree slot pre-initialization
- Add same-slot stacking for `erk implement` - stacks new branches on current branch instead of consuming a new slot
- Add "Changes" column to `erk slot list` showing dirty/clean status for each worktree
- Add `--dry-run` flag to `erk land` command to preview deletions without executing
- Bundle `dignified-python` skill with `erk sync` command by default

### Changed

- Clarify slot list UX with improved status ("available", "assigned", "error") and reason terminology
- Simplify slot unassign to accept only worktree names
- Rename objective plan creation command from `objective-create-plan` to `objective-next-plan`
- Rename pooled sync to pooled check
- Use `gt create` for branch creation when Graphite enabled
- Update CI workflows to use claude-haiku-4 instead of claude-opus-4-5

### Fixed

- Fix erk land UX issues: improve confirmation prompt clarity and prevent unwanted navigation
- Fix erk land to properly unassign pool slots instead of deleting them
- Fix pool_size config override when loading existing pool state
- Fix pooled implement shell integration registration
- Fix pooled unassign to checkout placeholder branch and validate worktree state
- Fix `erk pr land` failing when deleting remote branches from git worktrees
- Fix UserPromptSubmit hook matcher to apply to all prompts
- Fix delete remote branch for landing PRs via gh pr merge --delete-branch
- Suppress "branch not found" message during fork PR cleanup
- Fix erk land objective update flow and shell integration output routing
- Fix statusline detection to accept commands with or without uvx prefix
- Fix CLI crash when running outside git repository
- Fix slot selection to exclude initialized worktrees during on-demand creation

### Removed

- Delete auto-restack feature and related infrastructure
- Delete 9 dead erk exec commands
- Remove step progress tracking from implementation system - plans no longer require step metadata

## [0.3.3] - 2026-01-02 13:44 PT

### Changed

- Move erk-statusline from dev to core dependencies

### Fixed

- Fix BranchMetadata forward reference

## [0.3.2] - 2026-01-02 12:30 PT

### Major Changes

- **dignified-review**: Added AI-assisted code review as an optionally installed GitHub Action. Ensures compliance with dignified-python standards during code review by leaving comments on PRs. Comments are designed to be resolved via `/erk:pr-address`.

- **Top-level `erk land` command**: Promoted land from `erk pr land` to `erk land`. Now accepts PR numbers, URLs, or branch names. Includes shell aliases `br land` and `branch land`. Landing PRs is a high-frequency operation that deserves top-level access.

- **Cross-repo plan storage**: Plans can now be stored in a separate repository. Configure via `.erk/config.toml` with `[plans] repo = "owner/repo"`. This avoids polluting the main codebase with plan issues, particularly valuable for open source repos like dagster where we don't want erk-specific artifacts.

- **erk-statusline**: Added the erk statusline. Optionally installable via `erk init --statusline`. Displays current branch, worktree, GitHub checks status, PR info, and more. Provides at-a-glance visibility into your development state without running commands.

- **Graphite opt-in**: Graphite is now optional. Not everyone uses Graphite, so although you don't get stacking features, Graphite-less operation is now a fully supported workflow. Commands gracefully degrade to standard git operations.

### Added

- Add command logging for CLI audit trail
- Add step-based progress tracking with GitHub metadata sync
- Add per-artifact version and hash tracking for health monitoring
- Add dynamic tripwire enforcement system
- Add erk-statusline configuration to init and health checks
- Add copy-pasteable commands section to plan issues
- Add auto-rebase when local branch is behind remote before push
- Add `--session-id` flag to marker CLI commands for explicit session ID
- Add configurable `default` parameter to `user_confirm` function

### Changed

- Restructure init command with stepped flow and status line setup
- Standardize GitHub Actions workflow naming to kebab-case

### Fixed

- Fix `erk pr checkout` for stacked PRs
- Fix dignified-python skill LBYL vs try/except guidance
- Fix `erk wt delete --all` to show accurate PR/plan status in planning phase
- Fix confirmation prompt output to stderr for consistency
- Fix pr-address skill handling of outdated review threads
- Fix changelog commit hash marker parsing to expect backtick formatting
- Fix frontmatter deprecation warning cluttering test output
- Fix GitHub Actions shell specification in review workflows
- Fix Claude Code installation path in Docker image
- Fix status comparison: compare against `StatusData.loading()` not `is None`

## [0.3.1] - 2025-12-31 15:52 PT

### Fixed

- Make step extraction gracefully degrade to empty list on empty LLM output

### Changed

- Update release process documentation and consolidate into RELEASING.md

## [0.3.0] - 2025-12-31 14:13 PT

### Release Overview

This release dramatically simplifies erk's architecture by eliminating the kit system and consolidating artifact management into a single, automated workflow.

#### Kit System Eliminated

The kit system has been completely removed. Previously, users installed and managed "kits" (bundles of skills, commands, and agents) per-project. Now erk owns its artifacts directly:

- No `erk kit install`, `erk kit sync`, or kit registry commands
- Artifacts are bundled with erk itself and synced automatically
- One less concept to understand, one less thing to manage

#### Unified Artifact Management

erk now maintains a set of **bundled artifacts** that it syncs to target projects:

- **Skills**: `dignified-python`, `learned-docs`, `erk-diff-analysis`
- **Commands**: All `/erk:*` namespace commands (`/erk:plan-implement`, `/erk:pr-submit`, etc.)
- **Agents**: `devrun` (for running pytest/ty/ruff/make)
- **Workflows**: `erk-impl.yml` (for remote plan implementation via GitHub Actions)
- **Hooks**: `user-prompt-hook` and `exit-plan-mode-hook` (session management and plan tracking)

Running `erk init` or `erk artifact sync`:

1. Copies file-based artifacts to `.claude/` and `.github/workflows/`
2. Adds hook configurations to `.claude/settings.json`
3. Stamps the version in `.erk/state.toml` for staleness detection

`erk doctor` and `erk artifact check` detect stale, missing, or orphaned artifacts—including missing hook configurations. Projects keep full ownership of `.claude/`; erk only manages its namespaced artifacts.

#### Repo-Level Constraint

erk now requires Claude to be launched from the git repository root. This simplifies worktree detection, artifact paths, and context creation. If you previously ran Claude from subdirectories, launch from the repo root instead. This matches how most users already work and provides a stable foundation.

#### Global Install Required (UVX Not Supported)

We explored using `uvx erk` for zero-install usage, but this isn't feasible due to shell integration. Commands like `erk implement`, `erk up`, `erk down`, and `erk wt checkout` change your shell's working directory—something only a shell function can do. This requires a shell wrapper function (installed via `erk init --shell`) that calls a persistent `erk` binary in your PATH.

**The solution is simple**: Install erk globally with `uv tool install erk`. erk handles the rest:

- Each repo has a `.erk/required-erk-uv-tool-version` file specifying the required version
- If your installed version doesn't match, erk warns you immediately with the fix: `uv tool upgrade erk`
- One person on the team updates the version file; everyone else follows the prompt

You don't install erk into each project—just keep your global tool current and artifacts synced. erk tells you when action is needed.
