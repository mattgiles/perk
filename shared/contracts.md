# perk cross-plane contracts

The four language-neutral contracts both planes obey, authored once here and bundled into
each build artifact (`Q12`). These are **prose specs** (no parser): the Python CLI (`perk`)
and the TS extension (`@perk/pi`) each implement one side, against the exact names/paths/
fields pinned below. `perk doctor` (T6) verifies conformance.

The stage registry — the one *parsed* contract — is the sibling `registry.yaml`; its
`state_keys` block is the canonical vocabulary referenced throughout this document.

Source decisions: `Q1` (workflow-state), `Q2` (layout + run_id), `Q3` (verified linkage),
`Q9`/`Q10` (gateway). Pi mechanics are cited against
[pi--best-practices.md](../docs/pi--best-practices.md).

> launch/`PERK_RUN_ID` emit in **T4**, the gateway verification ops in **T5** (Python) /
> Phase 1 (TS). Gateway *mutation* ops are named here but **not authored** (payloads land in

## §8.1 · `.pi/workflow/` layout (Q2)

The local cache tier — written and read by **both** the CLI (exterior) and the extension
(interior). Fixed layout:

```
.pi/workflow/
├── plans/                  # materialized plan cache (canonical copy stays in GitHub)
├── plan-ref.json           # cache.plan-ref: the active plan->branch ref pointer (local mirror)
├── scratch/runs/<run_id>/  # per-run inter-process workflow files (diffs, generated bodies)
├── handoff/<run_id>.json   # pre-session CLI->extension cold-door state (claimed on session_start)
└── markers/                # existence-based friction semaphores (e.g. pending-learn)
```

- Keyed by the perk-owned **`run_id`** (a ULID — see §8.2), never the Pi session id (which
  does not exist yet at cold-door launch time).
- **Handoff blob:** `{ run_id, stage, mode, consumed }` (+ `pi_session_id` once claimed). The
  CLI's cold launch (`perk <stage>`, T4) writes it; the extension claims it on `session_start`
  and sets `consumed: true` (§8.2). `stage` is the target stage id — the launched session's
  interior *handler* acts on it (Phase 1); T4's extension reads only `mode`/`run_id`.
- **GC is perk-owned:** prune `scratch/runs/<id>/` + `handoff/<id>.json` for runs whose
  terminal stage completed, or older than N days — surfaced later as a `doctor` check + a
  prune command (erk accumulated session dirs precisely because GC was undefined).
- `.gitignore`: `.pi/workflow/` transient subtrees are not committed; `plans/` may be cached
  locally but GitHub is canonical. `init` manages the relevant `.gitignore` entries (incl.
  `/.pi/workflow/plan-ref.json` — a local mirror; the canonical plan lives in GitHub).
- **`plan-ref.json` (`cache.plan-ref`, T2b):** the provider-agnostic plan-ref payload (§8.4)
  written verbatim. One active ref per checkout/worktree (`.pi/workflow/` is per-checkout). The
  **Python cold door** (`perk plan-save`) writes it on a real save; the **extension** reads it
  on `session_start` to reconcile `active_plan_ref` (§8.3). The cross-plane contract is the
  *file* (`perk/cache.py` ↔ `extension/cache.ts`), not a shared module.

State keys (registry vocabulary): `cache.plan`, `cache.plan-ref`, `cache.scratch`,
`cache.handoff`, `cache.markers`.

---

## §8.2 · The `PERK_RUN_ID` protocol (Q2)

`run_id` is a perk-minted **ULID** (time-sortable → trivial chronological ordering and
"GC older than N" queries). It is simultaneously the **launch token**, the **cache key**
(`scratch/runs/<run_id>/`, `handoff/<run_id>.json`), and the **correlation key** tying the
CLI launcher → handoff blob → the session's `perk:workflow-state` entry → scratch dir →
GitHub event blocks → worker logs.

**Channel — an env var (the only clean Pi launch channel).** Pi exposes no first-class
"pass control data to the extension at launch" flag. The CLI sets `PERK_RUN_ID=<ulid>` in the
environment before `exec pi`; an initial message or `@file` would pollute LLM context.

**Claim (on `session_start`)** — strict verified linkage (`Q3` establish-before-consume):
1. read `process.env.PERK_RUN_ID`;
2. load + verify `handoff/<run_id>.json` (read-back; on mismatch raise a hard, actionable
   error — never a silent `pass`);
3. record `run_id` in `perk:workflow-state` (§8.3);
4. mark the handoff **consumed**.

**Fork ≠ branch (easy to get wrong).**
- A **fork** (`/fork`, `/clone`, `ctx.newSession({ parentSession })`, or a headless
  `pi --fork`) creates a **new session file** that inherits the parent's entries — so the
  parent's `perk:workflow-state` (hence its `run_id`) is present in the child's
  `getBranch()`. **Detect a fork by the `run_id ↔ pi_session_id` mapping, not the
  `session_start` reason:** a headless `pi --fork` arrives as `reason: "startup"` (not
  `"fork"`) with no `previousSessionFile`, so reason-based detection is unreliable. On
  `session_start`, compare the rebuilt entry's recorded `pi_session_id` to the **current**
  session handle (the basename of `getSessionFile()`): **equal ⇒ reload** (keep the
  `run_id`); **different ⇒ fork** — the `run_id` was inherited from another session, so
  **derive a child-scoped id `<run_id>.<n>`**, record the parent as `predecessor`, and
  isolate the child's scratch. Do **not** blindly inherit `PERK_RUN_ID` (that would hand the
  parent's id to the child).
- `/tree` branches **in place** (same file / UUID / process), so `PERK_RUN_ID` in the env
  survives and the `run_id` stays **stable**.

**Warm keeps / cold mints (matches the registry `run_id` policy).** A warm in-session stage
transition keeps the `run_id`; a cold relaunch mints a **new** `run_id` that **records its
predecessor**, so resume/relaunch chains stay traceable.

The Pi session UUID is kept as a **secondary handle** (needed for `SessionManager.open` /
`continueRecent` on resume); the `run_id ↔ pi_session_id` mapping lives in `perk:workflow-state`.

---

## §8.3 · The `perk:workflow-state` schema (Q1)

The single namespaced session entry holding transient (tier-3) workflow state.

**Record (per-field last-write-wins):**

| field | type | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `run_id` | string (ULID) | the perk run this session belongs to (§8.2) |
| `predecessor` | string \| null | the prior `run_id` this run forked from (or cold-relaunched after), §8.2; null for an original run |
| `pi_session_id` | string | the current session handle — the basename of Pi's session file; the **fork discriminator** (§8.2) and the key to resume via `SessionManager.open`/`continueRecent` |
| `mode` | string | the active registry stage `mode` (`read-only` / `read-write`) — **structurally gates tools** (P2.T1, see below) |
| `active_plan_ref` | object \| null | the provider-agnostic plan ref (§8.4); null during early `plan` |
| `active_objective` | string \| null | the active objective id (Phase 2; null in MVP) |
| `last_review_batch` | object \| null | the last processed review batch (Phase 2; null in MVP) |

**Persistence channel:** `pi.appendEntry("perk:workflow-state", data)`. (The *other* Pi
channel — tool-result `details` — is for state that *is* a tool's output; this is not that.)

**Rebuild (non-negotiable discipline, pi §4):** scan `ctx.sessionManager.getBranch()` for
`entry.type === "custom" && entry.customType === "perk:workflow-state"`, **on both
`session_start` AND `session_tree`** (skipping `session_tree` is the bug that makes state
stale after the user navigates the tree). Apply **per-field last-write-wins** so two tools
writing different fields in the same turn don't clobber each other.

**Subtlety borrowed from `plan-mode`:** when reconstructing state tied to a current
execution, only re-scan entries **after** the marker that began it, so stale fields from a
previous execution don't resurrect.

**Verified linkage tier (Q3):** the `run_id ↔ pi_session_id` mapping and `active_plan_ref`
are **strict** (durable/cross-process → read-back + correct ordering); purely transient
fields cheaply reconstructable on the next `session_start`/`session_tree` are
best-effort-with-logging (never silently swallowed).

**`active_plan_ref` reconciliation (T2b):** on `session_start`, after the run_id claim, the
extension reads `cache.plan-ref` and appends `active_plan_ref` **iff** the rebuilt value
does not already match the file — **idempotent by `(provider, pr_id)`** (so reloads don't
duplicate and a fork keeps the inherited ref), with a **strict read-back** (loud-but-
non-fatal on mismatch, headless-safe). `session_tree` re-reads nothing — the per-field LWW
rebuild already restores `active_plan_ref`, so branch navigation preserves it.

**Warm `/plan-save` direct linkage (T3):** the in-session warm door appends `active_plan_ref`
**directly** after a successful save (same strict read-back, idempotent by `(provider, pr_id)`),
so the live session is linked without waiting for the next `session_start`. Both writers feed the
same LWW field; a warm append makes the next reload's reconciliation a no-op. This makes the warm
`save` stage a direct writer of `session.workflow-state`.

State key (registry vocabulary): `session.workflow-state`.

**Session-lifecycle gates (T4b).** The interior guards `session_before_switch` /
`session_before_fork` with a **dirty-repo check** (`git status --porcelain` via `pi.exec`),
**scoped to active perk workflows** (`active_plan_ref != null` — perk never interferes with
non-perk forks/switches). A dirty tree in an active workflow returns `{ cancel: true }` with a
loud message (notify if UI, else stderr) — **fail-safe-headless** (it cancels in both modes; there
is no proceed-anyway in Phase 1). A clean tree, or any transition outside a workflow, is allowed
(returns `undefined`); if `git status` itself fails (e.g. not a repo) the gate allows (it is a
hygiene guard, not a repo validator). The warm `/implement` command is a **guard-only** twin that
*enforces* `implement.doors.warm: false`: inside an impl context (read-write mode + a linked
plan-ref) it acknowledges "continue"; otherwise it refuses and points to the cold door `perk
implement`. The proceed-anyway confirm dialog + `git-checkpoint` stash-on-turn are Phase 2.

**Tool-gating (P2.T1).** The `mode` field **structurally gates tools** — enforcement, not
prompting. When `mode == "read-only"` the interior (`extension/toolGating.ts`):
(1) restricts the active tool set to `["read", "grep", "find", "ls", "bash"]` via
`pi.setActiveTools`, **snapshot-then-restore** (snapshot `pi.getActiveTools()` on the off→on
transition; restore it on on→off, falling back to a read-write default); (2) blocks `edit`/`write`
and non-allowlisted `bash` commands at `tool_call` with `{ block: true, reason }` (a perk-owned
copy of plan-mode's destructive/safe regex tables); (3) injects a hidden `[READ-ONLY MODE]`
context at `before_agent_start` and **strips** that marker from `context` when off. The allowlist
is **restored on both `session_start` and `session_tree`** (re-sync from the rebuilt `mode`).
**Fail-closed:** the in-memory gate flag drives `tool_call`; a failed state-rebuild never opens the
gate (the sync is skipped), and `tool_call` blocks on any internal error. `mode` writes are
best-effort transient (no strict read-back). The `enter(ctx?)`/`exit(ctx?)` surface
(append `mode` + flip the gate) is the API the perk-owned plan mode (T2) and the read-only CI
executor (T5) consume; this primitive ships no `/plan` ownership and adds no registry stage.

## §8.4 · The GitHub gateway contract (Q9/Q10)

**One contract, implemented once per plane** (no shared module, no in-process coupling):
a `gh`-shelling gateway in the Python CLI (`init`/worker) and a `gh`-shelling gateway in the
TS extension (in-session mutations). Both conform to the **same operation names + payload
shapes**, so either can later swap `gh`-shell → API-backed independently, and `doctor` can
verify both.

### Verification-only operations (Phase 0 — authored now, **no mutation**)

These are all `init`/`doctor` needs in Phase 0 (`Q9`: verification-only; the first label is
created lazily by `/plan-save` in Phase 1). **Implemented in the Python plane (T5):**
`perk/github.py` (typed dataclasses mirroring these shapes); the TS plane follows in Phase 1.

```
check_auth()         -> { ok: bool, user: string|null, scopes: string[], error: string|null }
                        # `gh auth status` (+ `gh api user`); never mutates.
check_repo_access()  -> { ok: bool, repo: string|null, can_push: bool, error: string|null }
                        # `gh repo view`; can_push from viewerPermission ∈ {WRITE,MAINTAIN,ADMIN}.
```

`require_github(ctx)` is the **strict DI binding** for Phase-1+ commands (raises
`UserFacingCliError` / `error_type: github_unauthed` when unauthed); `init`/`doctor` call the
`check_*` ops directly to *report* (non-fatal — see §8.5).

### Mutation operations

**Authored (P1.T2a — the plan write).** REST `gh api`; mutations **raise** on failure (the
command boundary maps to `UserFacingCliError`), lookups return `… | null`:

```
create_label{ name, color, description }            -> Label{ name, created }
    # POST repos/{o}/{r}/labels; HTTP 422 ⇒ created:false (idempotent)
create_plan_issue{ title, body, labels[], run_id }  -> PlanIssue{ number, url, existed }
    # POST repos/{o}/{r}/issues (-F body=@file); idempotent on run_id
add_issue_comment{ issue, body }                    -> CommentResult{ posted }
    # POST repos/{o}/{r}/issues/{n}/comments (the plan-body first comment)
find_plan_issue{ run_id }                           -> PlanIssue | null
    # GET repos/{o}/{r}/issues?labels=perk:plan&state=open + header run_id match
```

- **Idempotency** is keyed on the header `run_id`, discovered via the **list** endpoint (not
  the eventually-consistent search index), create-then-return (`Q3` establish-before-record).
- **`perk:plan` label** is created lazily on first save.

**Authored (P1.T5a — the submit path).** REST `gh api`; idempotent via the list endpoint:

```
default_branch()                                    -> string
    # gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef (the PR base)
find_pr_for_branch{ branch }                        -> PullRequest | null
    # GET .../pulls?head=<owner>:<branch>&state=all (prefers an open PR)
create_pr{ head, base, title, body, draft }         -> PullRequest{ number, url, is_draft, state, existed }
    # POST .../pulls (-F body=@file); idempotent on head (find-then-create)
update_plan_header{ issue, fields }                 -> PlanHeaderUpdate{ fields_updated[], dry_run }
    # GET issue body -> merge fields into the plan-header block -> PATCH .../issues/{n}
    # rejects unknown header keys (LBYL on the schema); submit sets branch/pr/lifecycle_stage=impl
get_plan{ number }                                  -> PlanState{ number, url, title, header, pr } | null
    # gh issue view --json (+ pulls/{n} when the header carries pr); the `perk resume` read (T5c)
```

- **PR body (P1.T5a, minimal):** `Closes #<issue>` (so the squash-merge closes the plan) + a
  `Plan: #<issue>` link + a **plain-text** `` `gh pr checkout <n>` `` footer (no HTML — erk's
  tripwire). Full-plan re-embedding + AI body craft are Phase 2.

**Authored (P1.T5b — the land path).** Idempotent; the caller checks PR state before merging:

```
mark_pr_ready{ number }                             -> void
    # gh pr ready <n> — the ONE non-REST op (draft->ready is GraphQL-only); called only on a draft
merge_pr{ number, commit_message? }                 -> PullRequest (state MERGED)
    # PUT .../pulls/{n}/merge (merge_method=squash); idempotent ("already merged" ⇒ success)
```

- **`Closes #<issue>`** rides in the PR body (T5a) so the squash-merge closes the plan issue;
  `commit_message` repeats it belt-and-suspenders. Post-merge state is **derived from PR**, never
  stored (Q8).

**Still named-only (payloads deferred to their stage — authoring ahead is fiction):**

- `resolve_review_threads` — the `address` loop (Phase 2).
  - **Known durable shape to keep when authored** (PRIOR_ART §5/§11): the payload is
    `[{ thread_id, comment }]` (objects, not a flat list). Review threads are a *distinct*
    GitHub API from discussion comments — counted separately.

### Plan-ref payload (provider-agnostic; full schema → Phase 1)

`active_plan_ref` / `cache.plan-ref` is **provider-agnostic** from day one (PRIOR_ART §2 —
erk migrated away from GitHub-specific refs and issue-numbers-in-branch-names):

```
{ provider: string,            # e.g. "github"
  pr_id: string,               # STRING (allows non-numeric ids like Jira "PROJ-123")
  url: string,                 # during planning: the plan issue url/id; branch/pr staged null
  labels: string[],            # ["perk:plan"]
  objective_id: string|null }  # Phase 2
```

**Plan-header block (P1.T2a — the queryable metadata in the issue *body*).** The minimal
observably-distinct set; rendered as a `perk:metadata-block:plan-header` collapsible YAML
block; the full plan markdown lives in the `plan-body` first comment:

```
{ run_id: string,              # the §8.2 run that created the plan (idempotency key)
  lifecycle_stage: string,     # "planned" (Q8: collapses planned→impl; post-states from PR)
  branch: string|null,         # staged — populated at submit
  pr: string|null,             # staged — populated at submit
  created: string,             # ISO-8601 UTC
  objective_id: string|null }  # Phase 2
```

**Label taxonomy (minimal, PRIOR_ART §2/§6):** one label `perk:plan` in the MVP; type labels
(learn/objective) land with their stages. Query by a **single** label — GitHub label filters
are AND-semantics.

**The `pending-learn` semaphore (P1.T5b; Q2/Q5).** An existence-only `cache.markers` file
(`.pi/workflow/markers/pending-learn`, name shared as `PENDING_LEARN` in both planes): **`land`
sets it** (after a successful merge), **`learn` clears it**. While present it signals the
land→learn cycle is open and the worktree is not yet releasable (a future `worktree remove` /
`doctor` honors it). `learn` is **thin and TS-only** this phase — it clears the marker; the
agentic capture + a `perk:learn` label/issue is Phase 2.

## §8.5 · The `init` machine surface (T5; cli-vs-pi §3.2)

`perk init` is a **supervisor surface**: human text → stderr, `--json` → stdout (one object),
stable exit codes. The agent never parses it (it calls extension tools); the consumer is a
process orchestrating sessions.

**Exit codes.** `0` converged · `1` invalid input (`invalid_settings` / `invalid_config`) ·
`2` environment-not-ready (`not_a_repo` / `missing_tool`). GitHub-unauthed is **non-fatal** in
`init` (reported, exit 0); `github_unauthed` is reserved for the strict `require_github` path.

**`--json` object.**
```
{ success: bool, mode: "self"|"consumer"|"unknown", error_type: string|null, message: string|null,
  env:     [ { name, ok, detail, remediation } ],          # required-tooling checks
  github:  { auth: { ok, user, scopes[], error },          # null when env-not-ready / verify skipped
             repo: { ok, repo, can_push, error } },
  capabilities: string[],                                  # the managed inventory (perk/capabilities.py)
  changes: string[],                                       # converged/seeded pieces ([] ⇒ already converged)
  handoff: string|null }                                   # path to the post-init markdown on-ramp
```

The **post-init handoff** (`handoff`) is an *agent-readable* markdown at
`.pi/workflow/post-init.md` (gitignored; regenerated each init) — distinct from the §8.1
machine run-handoff JSON. It is the Phase-0 dogfood on-ramp.

**Capability inventory.** `perk/capabilities.py` is the declared SSOT of what `init` manages
(required-vs-optional + self-vs-consumer scope). Phase 0 ships an all-required set; `doctor`
**(T6, implemented)** reuses it for health-check filtering (the inventory's `verify()` side). The
installed-optional state file + `Capability` ABC are deferred until the first *optional*
capability exists.

## §8.6 · The `doctor` machine surface (T6; cli-vs-pi §3.2)

`perk doctor` is the **second** supervisor surface (the agent never parses it). It is `init`'s
diagnostic twin: `init` converges *forward*, `doctor` **reports** coherence and `--fix` **repairs**
drift. Managed-piece checks reuse `init`'s convergence helpers in **dry-run** (`apply=False`) — so
init and doctor share one desired-state SSOT — and `--fix` runs the same helpers with `apply=True`.
Shipped as a Click **group** (`invoke_without_command=True`) so the Phase-3 `doctor workflow`
subgroup slots in without a breaking change.

**Exit codes (report-don't-refuse, D5).** `0` healthy (warnings allowed) · `1` unhealthy (≥1
failing check) · `2` `not_a_repo`. A **missing required tool is a failing check (exit 1)**, *not*
exit 2 — doctor's job is to report tool problems, not refuse to run; only `not_a_repo` blocks.
GitHub readiness is **non-fatal** (`warn`, never `fail`); doctor **never mutates** GitHub.

**No silent pass.** A check that cannot be evaluated (a shell raised, a file is unreadable) reports
`warn`/`info` with the reason in `detail` — never a silent `ok`.

**`--json` object.**
```
{ success: bool,                         # the command ran (false only on not_a_repo)
  healthy: bool,                         # no failing checks
  self_repo: bool,                       # self (perk's own repo) vs consumer dual-mode
  error_type: string|null,               # "not_a_repo" on the exit-2 path
  message: string|null,
  checks: [ { name, group, status, message, detail, remediation } ],   # status ∈ ok|warn|info|fail
  summary: { passed: int, warnings: int, failed: int },
  fixed: string[] }                      # repairs applied by --fix ([] otherwise)
```

**Groups.** `environment` (tools; missing = `fail`) · `github` (auth/access; non-fatal `warn`) ·
`package` (settings wiring) · `repository` (gitignore/agents blocks + config present/valid) ·
`registry` (the registry self-check) · `state` (the `.pi/workflow/` cache layout + handoff-blob
integrity). Managed-piece checks are filtered by `capabilities.applicable(self_repo)`; infra checks
always run. Human render (stderr) follows the three-way condensed rule per group (collapse a clean
group; else expand only its failures/warnings); `--verbose` expands every check.
